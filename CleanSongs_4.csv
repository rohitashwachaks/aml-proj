0,Don Everly,Yesterday Just Passed My Way Again,"I can't believe your lips are touchin' mine
After all the hurt and all this time
But I believe that sometimes losers win
Yesterday just passed my way again
I should have known the tears I made you cry
Would never mean we'd really say goodbye
Tonight sweetheart we're back were we began
Yesterday just passed my way again
They say you can't turn back the hands of time
But tonight I'm holdin' the hands that once were mine
And you're lovin' me as if the world might end
Yesterday just passed my way again
Yesterday just passed my way againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
1,Don Everly,Love at Last Sight,"The barroom is closin'
And the bartender sacks me six to go
There's two losers left here
Me and some girl I don't know
We walk out together
With no-one to hold through the night
And out on the street, our lonely eyes meet
And we know we've found at last sight
Love at love sight
We've no voice, no choice in the matter
Love at last sight
'Cause we're all that's left of together
We reach out our hands
Then we touch
Then we hang on for life
Everyone's gone and we're all alone
And we know we've found love at last sight
Everyone's gone and we're all alone
And we know we've found at last sightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
2,Don Everly,Brother Jukebox,"Brother Jukebox, sister wine
Mother freedom, father time
Since she left me by myself
You're the only family I've got left
Brother Jukebox, sister wine
Mother freedom, father time
Since she left me by myself
You're the only family I've got left
I go down to the same old café
Where I try to wash my troubles away
I'm still down and I'm still all alone
But it beats stayin' home all night long
Brother Jukebox, sister wine
Mother freedom, father time
Since she left me by myself
You're the only family I've got left
You're the only family I've got leftEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
3,Don Everly,Did It Rain,"She slipped off softly in the early morning rain
Up on a hillside for a place to hide her pain
Breaking the cobwebs from the branches of the pine
Asking forgiveness for me and my short time
And did it rain, and did it rain
And is there a such place called empty
And did it rain, and did it rain
And is there such place called time left on your mind
I know the writer of the song she sadly sings
She rides a pony and her cape flies in the wind
Checking the dew-drops on the branches of the corn
She rides to keep her strange appointment with the dawn
And did it rain, and did it rain
And is there a such place called empty
And did it rain, and did it rain
And is there such place called time left on your mind
And did it rain, and it rain
And is there a such place called empty
And did it rain, and did rain
And is there such place called time that’s on your mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
4,Don Everly,Lettin’ Go,"Our love lost all inspiration
God knows we tried hangin’ on
But we’re tired of misty conversations
Darling the time has finally come
For lettin’ go
It all started like a fever
Love so warm, so easy to hold
But love left, it slipped through our fingers
Darling the time has finally come
For lettin’ go
Somewhere along the line
Love just drifted away, drifted away
I guess we were just too close to know
Kiss me, baby, let it linger
Darling the timе has finally come
For lettin’ goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
5,Don Everly,Turn the Memories Loose Again,"I don’t look like that picture
But I know that it’s me
And I don’t sound the same way I did then
But I can sing an old song
Made famous way back when
And I can turn the memories loose again
I never thought of money
They just told me it was there
A brand new car for a brand new millionaire
But fame can be a feather that’s caught up in the wind
And I can turn the memories loose again
Dreams that disappeared can come alive today
The love you thought was gone, still lingers in a song
I’ve seen the world through windows from busеs, cars and planes
Success can be a freedom or a chain
I don’t rеgret one moment, all I did was sing
And I can turn the memories loose again
Dreams that disappeared can come alive today
The love you thought was gone, still lingers in a song
I don’t regret one moment all I did was sing
And I can turn the memories loose again
And I can turn the memories loose againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
6,Don Everly,Do You Love Me,"Do you love me
Make up your mind
Do you need me
For real this time
My darling can’t you see
You mean more than life to me
Do you love me
Do you love me
I’m giving up
This heart can’t stand
To live its life
At your command
Love, it’s gotta give
You’ve gotta let me know
Before I fall some more
Do you love me
Do you love me
Love, it’s gotta give
You’ve gotta let me know
Before I fall some more
Do you love me
Do you love mеEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
7,Don Everly,Jack Daniels Old No. 7,"A woman wrings her hands and cries “I've lost my man”
You should-a seen him roll the diesel 'cross the land
Now you'll find him up on Lynchburg, Tennessee
Collecting bottles in his old dungarees
At the Silver Dollar Saloon
Gonna break him out here soon
Jack Daniel's Old No 7
Tennessee sour-mash whiskey
Jack Daniel's Old No 7
Tennessee sour-mash whiskey
Bogie Bogart cried, “Lauren, let's sail to sea
And when I'm dyin' have another drink for me”
Now you’ll find him up on Lynchburg all the time
They keep him waiting, at the end of the line
At the honky-tonky parade
Look at all thе parts he played
Jack Daniels Old No 7
Tеnnessee sour-mash whiskey

8,Don Everly,My Friend,"Don't think the road's that easy
Walk away or run
Don't think the light's that easy
No matter where it's from
Life's the illusion, ain't it fun
Well this one is mine, my friend
Hold life the way you want to
When it falls in your hand
Listen to what you're saying
And try to understand
Is this life you really planned?
Well, this one is mine, my friendEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
9,Don Everly,"Oh, What a Feeling","It must be love
Oh what a feeling
I sit at home alone
I wait here by the phone
I know you'll never call
Oh what a feeling
It must be love
Although it's bitter
It must be love
I can't forget her
The days turn into weeks
You're letters I shall keep
The ones you didn't write
Oh what a feeling
It must be love
Oh what a feeling
It must be love
Oh what a feelingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
10,Don Everly,So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad),"We used to have good times together
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad
Remember how you used to feel dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
Is it any wonder
That I feel so blue
When I know for certain
That I'm losing you
Remember how you used to feel dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
So sad to watch good love go badEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
11,Don Everly,Safari,"Think of the things you’re going to see
Safari
Think of the world the way it used to be
Safari
We didn’t give you a chance to live
Now we’re sorry
We didn’t think you’d give us all there was to give
Now we’re back where we started
Land of the Zulu that used to be free
Safari
Now they depend on what the tourists want to see
Safari
We didn’t give them a chance to live
Oh so sorry
We didn’t think we’d take all there was to give
Now we’re back where we started
Durban to Cape Town, fly African plane
Safari
Lion and zebra down there on the range
Safari
We didn’t think they would just disappear
Oh we’re sorry
We didn’t listen until too late to hear
Now we’re back where we started
Manhattan skyline made of concrete
Safari
Now we find the jungle right there in the street
Safari
We didn’t know there was another way to live
Now we’re sorry
We didn’t think you’d grow up to be so big
Now we’re back where we started
Doo up doo up do do up doo up...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
12,Don Everly,My Baby,"I'll ride on a freight train
Find a place for my head
I'll walk the new highways
With your back on my bed
I need to be there when you need me
It's such a lovely sun
My baby
You laugh, you cry to put things together
You sleep, you wake to look at the weather
For a while you just open up your eyes
You seem to grow so fast
I can't catch the dream that lasts
Inside the dream that you're dreaming
When you're sitting on my knee
My baby
So daddy's dream will have to be there
While he's gone to be in dreams
You will see somеday
I hope they make you smilе
My babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
13,Don Everly,Sweet Dreams,"Sweet dreams of you every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me it's plain
I should know you'll never wear my name
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Sweet dreams of you every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me it's plain
I should know you'll never wear my name
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
14,Don Everly,Helpless When You’re Gone,"The sun came up today
It warmed my heart, then went away
It reminded me of you
That’s something you would do
I’m helpless when you’re gone
The moon was there tonight
Amidst the stars it touched a light
It reminded me of you
That’s something you could do
I’m helpless when you’re gone
A song can take so long
It fills you up and then it’s gone
It reminds me of you
That’s something you would do
I’m helpless when you’re goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
15,Don Everly,Deep Water,"I'm drifting into deep water
I'm starting to care for you
You're gettin' me in deep water
Be careful what you do
You want a romance but I'm seeking love
I know I'll regret it when it ends
Oh' I'm winding up in deep water
Why can't we just be friends
It's restless in this deep water
I'm lost between right and wrong
My love is true as deep water
Your love won't last as long
Where will it lead me and where will it end
I can't help but wish I only knew
Oh I'm winding up in deep water
So deep in love with you
I'm drifting into deep waterEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
16,Don Everly,When I Stop Dreaming,"When I stop dreaming
That's when I’ll stop loving you
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop wanting you
When I stop dreaming
That’s when I'll stop crying for you
The worst that I've ever, been hurt in my life
The first time I ever, wanted to die
Was the night she told me you loved someone else
And asked me if I, could forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you
I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring
Alone and neglected, transplantеd in vain
To a garden of sadness wherе its petals would fall
In the shadow of undying pain
You may teach the flowers, to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble, and teach it to grow
You can teach all the raindrops, to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I’ll stop loving you
When I stop dreaming
That’s when I'll stop loving youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
17,Don Everly,Eyes of Asia,"Yes it was loving you
That drove me from my mind
Yes it was touching you
That made the heartache mine
This time for certain, certain this time
The eyes of Asia
Are the eyes of an old-fashioned girl
Yes it was being there
That made the pleasure mine
And oh how the crowd would cheer
When the clown forgot his lines
This time for certain, certain this time
The eyes of Asia
Are thе eyes of an old-fashioned girl
So what arе you looking for
Has the table got no wine
How can you walk away
When the conversation’s mine
This time for certain, certain this time
The eyes of Asia
Are the eyes of an old-fashioned girl
Where will the banquet be
Will the harvest be on time
How will the forest look
When the blind man blows his mind
This time for certain, I’m certain this time
The eyes of Asia
Are the eyes of an old-fashioned girl
Are the eyes of an old-fashioned girlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
18,Don Everly,Don’t Drink the Water,"Don’t drink the water
It won’t bring relief
It will only numb your mind
And send you off to sleep
It won’t be there when you’re thirsty
Deserts all you see
Vulture’s gonna pick your bones
And eat up your beliefs
Don’t drink the water
You know I’ve, I’ve grown tired of its taste
You can smell the human waste
Don’t drink the water
Don’t drink the water
It can’t satisfy
It will only blow you up and shut your eyes
And it won’t be there when you need it
Suffering all alone
When it has turned to vapour
You must stand alone
Don’t drink the watеr
You know I’ve grown tired of its taste
You can smеll human waste
Don’t drink the water
Don’t drink the water, drink the wine
Oh, don’t drink the water
You know you can’t survive
Take a look around you
You can see it in their eyes
It only wants to pick you up
Hold you in its hand
Then it’s gonna drink you up
Laugh when you can’t stand
Don’t drink the water
You know I’ve grown tired of its taste
You can smell the human waste
Don’t drink the water
Don’t drink the water
Don’t drink the water
Don’t drink the waterEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
19,Don Everly,Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"I'm a roaming cowboy  riding all day long
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
Nights underneath a prairie moon
I ride alone and sing a tune
See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
I know when night has gone that a new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweedsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
20,Don Everly,Thinking It Over,"All of a sudden you make up your mind
Tell me that you love me and have always been mine
But things are changing, dear
I'm not so blind, I'm thinking it over
It's funny how tables turn now
Wouldn't you say
Things are getting sticky, dear
It's who's gonna stay
I bet it feels quite strange
To come back and find I'm thinking it over
The uncertain look I see in your eyes
Has been in mine too long
The feeling you have when you look at the floor
Isn't mine anymore
You look like you need me
I guess I should stay
Pick up the pieces, dear
And put them away
I hope you learned a lesson, dear
It's not too late, I'm thinking it overEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
21,Don Everly,Southern California,"Bound for California
Fly across your dateline
You weigh heavy on a friend of mine
Oh I think I’d need a change
From Smallwood Oklahoma
And the sound of the Creole band
Or the thrills of the candy man
Southern California
Oh I want to be a star
Southern California
Please remain the way you are
Fly across your dateline
You weigh heavy on a friend of mine
Southern California
Oh I want to be a star
Southern California
Please remain the way you are

22,Don Everly,February 15th,"I’d like to thank you for those moments
When you made my face smile
I’ll hang on to those forever
Now that they’re here you can’t take them away
Even if you tried
Seven days and seven lonely nights
Woke up today
Opened my eyes and just slipped away
Look at me now
I’m riding away on a silver cloud
How can it be
All those lost summers are in front of me
Where can she be
She’s there where I’m going
Where she should be
All I want to know is inside of me
Telling me - let it go
Just one more day
To learn all the lines and throw the book away
Love’s only love
Is easy to please and that’s the 1-2-3
Like ivy climbing on a wall
I continue to fall
Through the wonder of it allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
23,Don Everly,Melody Train,"Let me take you far away from here
High on a dream
Halfway to stardom
Honesty grows in your garden
Hitch a ride on a melody train
Going down
Tie your eyes to the journey I made
In my sound
Each one is Kansas City bound
Tie the longhorn to the wagon wheels
Dust on the rise, cowboy and Dago
Blazin’ a trail to the rainbow
Hitch a ride on a melody train
Going down
Tie your eyes to the journey I made
In my sound
Each one is Kansas City boundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
24,Don Everly,Brand New Rock ‘n’ Roll Band,"The country I’m a-livin’ in is nearer to the sun
Higher to heaven than the place we’re born
And the train came from
Wanna stick around for the mornin’ sun
The only sun I care about I get from my own child
I’d like to see my woman
But I can live with steel ‘n’ slide
I wanna stick around for the mornin’ flight
Headed back to God’s own country
Headed back to God’s own land
With that same old restless feelin’ in my heart

25,Don Everly,The Way You Remain,"Even now, as I am
And us, the way we were
Leaving times for you to change
I think of you the way you remain
Even us, as we were
And what we might have been
Don't it all soon change
I think of you the way you remain
Time and time alone could make a change
Making me the way I am
Leaving you the way you are
Never having made love to you seems strange
Leaving you, believing you
And leaving you unchanged
Don’t it all seem strange
I think of you the way you remainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
26,Don Everly,It’s All Over,"It's all over
Didn't even cry
I just stopped living
When you said goodbye
It's all over
Didn't feel a thing
I just stopped living;
Couldn't stand the pain
Hair of gold like leaves in September
Lips as fresh as spring
Love that warms like summer sun
Shouldn't die when winter comes

27,Don Everly,Since You Broke My Heart,"They say the blues went out of style
To cry is to act just like a child
While each day that we're apart
Love, how can it be I never will

Just play a few hands of solitaire
Read a book, or study art
All the remedies don't work for me
Since you broke my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

30,Don Everly,Omaha,"It's hard to remember Pittsburgh properly
It’s hard to recall what I did in D.C
No vivid remembrance of things in L.A
The times and the places have all slipped away
In one too brief minute
My mind saw it all
The time and the place
Twelve o'clock noon
Omaha
Omaha
It seems that I found everything that I wanted
All in Omaha
Everything's there my love and my laughter
It’s all in Omaha
I'm going back to Omaha
My Omaha
I'm going back to Omaha
Oh my Omaha
The rest of the world doesn't matter
When you find what you're after
Bells and candles, clocks that chime
Ribbons glass, lights that shine
Coloured paper, shiny beads
Everything that I need
You gave to me
In OmahaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
31,Don Everly,Takin’ Shots,"As I look around from my outpost on the hill
There ain’t much single sight of my platoon
Just a row of empty helmets and ammunition shells
Guess they all got up and run for ’elp
Ain’t there anybody out there, takin’ shots anymore
Did they all give up and go to fight their own private war
Ain’t there anybody out there, takin’ shots anymore
Am I left here on my own
Is that Ruby on the phone
I ain’t home
If I wave my white flag and I surrendered would you know it
Would I prove that our position to hypnotic sense to call
In my cause I have wanderеd, from the subject to the point
In my timе I have changed, both my reason and my mind
Ain’t there anybody out there, takin’ shots anymore
Did they all give up and go to fight their own private war
Ain’t there anybody out there, takin’ shots anymore
Am I left here on my own
Is that Ruby on the phone
I ain’t home
Ain’t there anybody out there, takin’ shots anymore
Did they all give up and go to fight their own private war
Ain’t there anybody out there, takin’ shots anymore
Am I left here on my own

32,Harry Styles,Sign of the Times,"Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets? Your bullets?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? Your bullets?

We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away

34,Harry Styles,Falling,"I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

36,Harry Styles,Medicine,"Lyrics from live performances

I’m here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with you
Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, I’m feeling it out
I’m feeling it out

I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you tasted

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh

Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are here
I mess around with them
And I'm okay with it
I'm coming down, I figured out I kinda like it
And when I sleep, I'm gonna dream of how you ride it

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh

I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep, I’m gonna dream of how you tasted

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh

You've got my devotion

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you

We're both stubborn, I know
But oh

Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home

Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me

Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
This was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see

47,Harry Styles,From the Dining Table,"Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool

We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine

I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name
We haven't spoke since you went away

Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?

Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel

I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel

How would I tell her that she's all I think about?
Well, I guess she just found out

She's a good girl

55,Harry Styles,Oh Anna,"Don’t know where you’re laying
Just know it’s not with me
Don’t know what I’d tell you if
I passed you on the street

I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)

Don’t know how you taste when
There’s smoke in your perfume
Chew me up and spit me out
Nothing left to lose

I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)

I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)

Hope you never hear this
And know that it’s for you
I don’t know what I’d tell you if
You asked me for the truth

I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)

Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body

I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take

57,Harry Styles,Don’t Let Me Go,"Now you were standing there right in front of me

66,Harry Styles,Dream With Me,"Hello, I’m Harry Styles, and tonight I’m going to help you drift off to sleep with some soothing words and calming music. A sleep story just for you. With all the business of your day, I know how hard it can be to go to sleep. So, thank you for choosing this story, and me, to help you. I wish you a wonderful night sleep. So make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath in, and then out. In, and then out. And when you’re ready, close your eyes
Have you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? When you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to look
Tonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like. So, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night. Settle back and clear your mind. We’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestial
I’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars. Which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are. As you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skies
Think about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above. The power of the universe meanders through your mind. So, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can find
Let’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and I could dream about forever. Imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palms
A gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees. We’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity. So, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinity
Picture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew. Inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you. Leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a stream
Dappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread. The dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads. Occasionally they kiss our cheeks. Small pleasures; quenching needs
Holding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook. Its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look. A shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above. The world we think but dare not speak, is L-O-V-E; love
Now, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours. As willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers. Gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass by
The wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross. For some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lost
Passing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow. A symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes. Nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysers
Strolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall. Its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall. The raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies. Peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skies
The fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing gift
Sheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down. But, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town. A gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blur
We find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake. All crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake. The scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones. As looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stones
The stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm. Herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deer
Strands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky. Mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly. In the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow. The kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go
Contemplating nothingness, a scene takes shape before us. And as it sharpens in our thoughts, we hear a distant chorus, the dampened sound of silence that only snow can bring, surrounds us with its calming vibes, and touches us within
Glistening snowflakes fall in flurries. Mountain rivers freeze, the powdery slopes look beautiful, and fresh snow dusts the trees. Somehow, now, we’re in a cabin, taking in this view as the fire crackles in the corner just for me and you
We linger for a moment, or maybe it’s been hours for when we blink and look again, our vistas waft in flowers. Another destination lulls us; closer now, it seems. Perhaps it’s real, or just another chapter in our dreams
Drifting in and out of sleep, our thoughts take us elsewhere, to an island fringed by swaying palms, lush beyond compare. A path winds through the mangroves towards a distant beach, that underlines the turquoise ocean. Now, within our reach
Eventually, we feel the powdery sand right beneath our feet. The sun above now blessing us with gentle, soothing heat. We hear the lilting sound of surf breaking up ahead, while spiral shells and pearly shards determine where we tread
Finally, a lapping wave engulfs our sandy feet. It seems to pause and ruminate, then gradually retreat. We dig our toes in cool, wet sand. Then, sit and face the sea and let the sound wash over us. Alone, just you and me
Staring at the nothingness that stretches on forever, our thoughts dovetail and unify in tune, two minds together. As minutes turn to hours, we drift off somewhere new and visualize a stairway to a door we now walk through
Imagine now a meadow on a balmy afternoon. Birds, and bees, and rustling trees create a summer tune, flanked by fields of sunflowers. Hand-in-hand we walk as the gentle sound of nature surrounds us while we talk
The sunflowers give the scenery a warm and golden hue, while hazy sunshine softens our idyllic, rustic view. As we roam past hedgerows, a farmhouse sits alone. Its open shutters pressed against uneven walls of stone
A garden winds around the house and daisies poke through grass. A bench that’s lived through countless summers creeks as we walk past. We wonder if the house is empty; once loved, but no longer. The thought of passing time inspires a feeling that grows stronger
This feeling washes over us, lost between a sight. And as the sun begins to set, we stop and wonder why gravity caresses us and pulls you close to me. Then, the scene begins to fade on new reality
Deeper, gradually deeper, we drift and now transcend to unfamiliar places. Too surreal to comprehend. Slowly, we capitulate, as sleep begins to call. Entwined in dreams and shifting scenes, we drift and gently fall
Friendly faces, glorious places, things we hope to do; intertwined with snapshots. Some of me, and some of you. Moonlit valleys, verdant forests, gazing at the ocean, summer meadows, tranquil sunsets, steeped in pure emotion
The tenderness we feel when we are close, two minds as one, surrounds us and connects us. But, we’ve only just begun. For now, we dream together of all that is to follow. And now that sleep will keep us safe, for now until tomorrow
Maybe all the memories that we’ve gathered here tonight are all dreams now remembered, or wishes in plain sight. No matter what, they’re with us now, for this night and forever. And every time we close our eyes, they’re yours and mine to treasure

You are my saviour, far from my enemy

I adore getting grabbed by your attention
And I'm desperate to feel your devotion
And my love, when I hear your soft voice
My spine is burning to ashes and the lust grows

73,Harry Styles,Stockholm Syndrome,"Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to
Being held by you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

Who's this man that's holding your hand
And talking about your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
All my life I've been on my own
I use the light to guide me home
But now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Baby, look what you've done
(Look what you've done to me)

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

76,Harry Styles,Vossi Bop,"Merky-ky-ky-ky-ky
London

My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy

You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds and made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like, ""What a goddess"" (Thank God)
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest (Ayy)
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris
Fuck the government and fuck Boris
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
I got the sauce, don't know what you thought
Catch me up in snowin' in my sliders and my shorts
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk
I don't fuck with her
Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her
Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie, way too exclusive
Chillin' in Dubai, know I get it all inclusive
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit
To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business
Lookin' in the mirror sayin', ""Mikey, you're the illest""
James Bond, tryna live my movie like I'm Idris
So we telling 'em look
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy

My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
So much Vossi I might open up a Vossi shop
Mummy sayin' that I need to get some sleep
All this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock
And all this stress has got me wreckin' up my brain (Ayy, ayy)
So tell these likkle fishes back up off my name (Ayy, ayy)
I ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain
Cah the rules are kinda different when you're baddin' up the game, straight
Baddin' up the game, bad it up again
Had 'em up before, have 'em up again (Ayy)
Fake bruddas, man, your mandem all pretend
Pussy by himself, he's badder with his friends, aww
You man are so insecure, man, it's a joke (Man, it's a joke)
I need a Ballon d'Or, 'cause I'm the GOAT (Still the GOAT)
If you believe in your sauce then raise a toast (Raise a toast)
These are some genius thoughts so make the most
Told her ""Save me some""
I need all the homage, could you pay me some?
Man a droppin' bangers on your baby mums
Gyal say I'm rude, they wanna see me nude
My name Stiff Chocolate, I got nothing left to prove
I got holes in my lapel, rubbin' shoulders with your girl
Which one of **** said that I would go to jail?
Well, I guess you have to hold a L
Tell 'em ""This is London city, we the hottest in the world""
What we tellin' em? Look
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy

78,Harry Styles,Space Cowboy,"After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too

So you've had a little trouble in town
So you're keeping some demons down
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

And jt's hard to think about what you've wanted
It's hard to think about what you've lost
Oo this doesn't have to be the big get even
This doesn't have to be anything at all

I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl

Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around
Oh yeah yeah

Well there's people running 'round loose in the world
Ain't got nothing better to do
Oo they make a meal of some bright-eyed kid
Oo you need someone looking after you

I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl

Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words

80,Harry Styles,Leather And Lace,"Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
You're saying I’m fragile, I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
'Cause I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know

But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won’t be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
Sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

Let's go, dance!
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between
And I'm acting like an angel underneath
Even if I look like a fool, a devil
I am a bad boy but for my girl a soft teen
Even if I passed the point of eighteen
In the hallway, I reminisce
About the moments, you with me
Kissing you under the starlight baby
You with me, under the sheets
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between
After the rave party, I see
Reflections of you, out in the streets
I cry baby but that's me
I love you more than you imagine
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between
And even If I'm far, you're still in my heart
Printed forever like a pleasing scar
And at the midnight the stars. unite us
Angels of the insane real world
You're my secret Wonderland, oh oh
I need to xertz the whole sea
To save you from drowning
A striver to survive, yeah
Preventing you from falling
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between
Oh between
How to end the space between?
You with me

Tenemos que escapar de aquí
Solo detén tu llanto, todo irá bien
Me dijeron que el fin está cerca
Tenemos que escapar de aquí
Solo detén tu llanto, pásatelo mejor que nunca
Atravesando la atmósfera
Y las cosas están bastante bien desde aquí
Recuerda que todo irá bien
Podemos vernos de nuevo en algún sitio
En algún sitio muy lejos de aquí

Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿Por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
De las balas, las balas?
Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿Por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
De las balas, las balas?

Solo detén tu llanto, es una señal de los tiempos
Tenemos que escapar de aquí

¿Por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
De las balas, las balas?
Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿Por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
De las balas, las balas?
No hablamos lo suficiente
Deberíamos abrirnos de par en par
Antes de que todo sea demasiado
¿Aprenderemos alguna vez?
Ya hemos pasado por esto antes
Es solo lo que conocemos

Detén tu llanto, cariño, es una señal de los tiempos
Tenemos que escaparnos, tenemos que escaparnos
Tenemos que escaparnos, tenemos que escaparnos
Tenemos que escapar
Llegamos, tenemos que, lejos
Llegamos, tenemos que, lejos
Llegamos, tenemos que, lejosEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
89,Harry Styles,Make It Feel Right (Unreleased),"I jump into knee deep water
But I’m sinking, somehow
Trouble on every corner
But you’re all I need now
You, you give me something
What it is I just don’t know
But I feel like a time bomb ticking
And without you I might blow
You give me the feeling
You give me a hiding place
Our love is bitter
But I really like the taste
Who said it was easy
Taking it day by day
But always remember
That I’ll love you anyway
You make it feel right
Oh Oh Ooh Oh Oh OohEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
90,Harry Styles,Two Ghosts (Türkçe Çeviri),"Aynı kırmızı dudaklar, aynı mavi gözler
Aynı beyaz tişört, birkaç tane daha dövme
Ama bu sen değilsin, ben değilim

Kulağa önceden hissettiğim bir şeymiş gibi geliyor
Ama gördüğüm şeye dokunamıyorum

Biz eski biz değiliz
Biz eski biz değiliz
Biz sadece kendi yerimize geçen iki hayaletiz
Kalbinin atmasının nasıl bir şey olduğunu hatırlamaya çalışıyoruz

Buzdolabının ışığı odayı beyaza bürüyor
Ay senin iyi tarafında dans ediyor
Ve bu eskiden bizim tüm ihtiyacımızdı
Sanki hiç tanışmamışız gibi dilimiz tutuldu
Zaten anlattığımız hikayeleri anlatıyoruz
Çünkü gerçekten kastettiğimiz şeyi söylemiyoruz

Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know

¿Cómo le diría que ella es en lo único en lo que pienso?
Bueno, supongo que lo acaba de descubrir
Ella es una buena chica

96,Bonnie Raitt,I Can’t Make You Love Me,"Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I’ll give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't

97,Bonnie Raitt,Angel from Montgomery,"I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child who's grown old
If dreams were thunder
And lightning was desire
This old house would've burned down
A long time ago
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
That was a long time
And no matter how I tried
The years just flow by
Like a broken down dam
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear all their buzzin'
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the morning
Come home in the evening
And have nothing to say
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
98,Bonnie Raitt,Nick of Time,"A friend of mine, she cries at night
And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes
And she wants one of her own
She's waited long enough she says
And still he can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose
And it tears her up inside
She is scared
Scared to run out of time
I see my folks are getting on
And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me
And it makes us both feel strange
No matter how you tell yourself
It's what we all go through
Those lines are pretty hard to take
When they're staring back at you
Oh Oh Oh, scared you'll run out of time
When did the choices get so hard
With so much more at stake
Life gets mighty precious
When there's less of it to wa-a-a-aste
Mmm-m-m-m-m-m
Mmmmmmm, scared you'll run out of time
Just when I thought I'd had enough
And all my tears were shed
No promise left unbroken
There were no painful words unsaid
Yo-o-o-u came along and showed me
I could leave it all behind
You opened up my heart again
And then much to my surprise
I found love, baby, love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love darlin', love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love baby, love in the nick of time
Ooooooo-ooo-ooo-whoo-ooo
Yeah baby
Uhhhhh-huh-uh
Found love...
In the nick of time...
Thought I'd given up...
Given up baby...

99,Bonnie Raitt,Something To Talk About,"People are talking, talking 'bout people
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
They think we're lovers kept under cover
I just ignore it, but they keep saying
We laugh just a little too loud
Stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long
Maybe they're seein' something we don't, darling

Let's give 'em something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?

I feel so foolish, I never noticed
You'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
It took the rumor to make me wonder
Now I'm convinced I'm going under
Thinkin' 'bout you every day
Dream 'bout you every night
I'm hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, let's really show it, darling
Let's give 'em something to talk about
A little mystery to figure out, babe
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?
Let's give 'em something to talk about, babe
A little mystery to figure out
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?
Ooh, listen to 'em baby
A little mystery won't hurt 'em
Let's give 'em something to talk about

100,Bonnie Raitt,Feels Like Home,"Something in your eyes
Makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself
In your arms
There's something in your voice
Makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts
The rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how low I've felt for so long
If you knew how I wanted someone
To come along
And change my life the way you've done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks
Down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see
Through the dark there's a light
If you knew how much this moment
Means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back
Where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
"
101,Bonnie Raitt,Thank You,"Sittin' here thinking, baby, about you
I'm wonderin' how I ever got through my life without you
Days passed me by and left my life somewhere behind
Games I was trying left me old before my time
You came into my life almost like you knew
The time was running out I came running home with you
You taught me how to love you
You helped me to believe
You could even love me
I was all you'd ever need
Sometimes when you're sleepin'
I wonder if its true
I'm afraid they'll come and take away this precious dream with you
Then you wake and hold me and love me through the night
Then I'll know that somehow everything will be alright
Thank you baby, for giving me my life
I love you honey, you've given me my life
Thank you baby, for giving me my lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
102,Bonnie Raitt,Runaway,"As I walk along I wonder what went wrong
With our love, a love that was so strong
And as still walk on I think of the things we've done
Together while our hearts were young
I'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain
Wishing you were here by me to end this misery
And I wonder, I wo wo wo wo wonder
Why, you ran away
And I wonder where you will stay
My little runaway, a runaway
(instrumental break)
I'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain
Wishing you were here by me to end this misery
And I wonder, I wo wo wo wo wonder, baby, yeah
You know why, you ran away

103,Bonnie Raitt,Love Me Like a Man,"The men that I've been seein', baby
Well they got their soul up on a shelf
You know they could never love me
Cause they can't even love themselves
But I need someone to love me
Someone to really understand
Who won't put himself above me
Who just loves me like a man
I never seen such losers
Don't think I haven't tried
Find a man to take me home
Instead of takin' me for a ride
And I need someone to love me
I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man
They all want me to rock them
Like my back ain't got no bone
I want a man to rock me
Like my back bone was his own
Darlin', I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man
I come home sad and lonely
Feel like I wanna cry
I want a man to hold me
Not some fool to ask me why
I know you can
Don't you put yourself above me
You just love me like a man

104,Bonnie Raitt,Love Has No Pride,"I've had bad dreams too many times
To think that they don't mean much anymore
Fine times have gone and left my sad home
Friends who once cared just walk out my door
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
I've been alone too many nights
To think that you could come back again
And I've heard you talk, ""she's crazy to stay""
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
If I could buy your love, I'd truly try, my friend
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees
Asking for you to come back, I'd be pleading for you to come back
Begging for you to come back to me
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one but myself to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
Yes, I'd give anything to see you againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Would you stand back, baby, 'cause I want to get a better look
The big man who couldn't handle the little bit of love you took
Hey, hey, have a heart
Hey, have a heart
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?
Have a heart, please

I told you yes, and then you told me no

106,Bonnie Raitt,Will the Sun Ever Shine Again,"Rain is pourin' down like the heavens are hurtin'
Seems like it's been dark since the devil knows when
How do you go on, never knowin' for certain
Will the sun ever shine again?

Feels like it's been years since it started to thunder
Clouds are campin' out in the valley and glen
How do you go on, when you can't help but wonder
Will the sun ever shine again?

What if the rain keeps fallin'?
What if the sky stays gray?
What if the winds keep squallin'
And never go away?

Maybe soon the storm will be tired of blowin'
Maybe soon it all will be over, amen
How do you go on, if there's no way of knowin'?
Will the sun ever shine?
Wish I could say
Send me a sign-
One little ray
Lord, if you're list'nin', how long
Until then?
Will the sun ever shine again?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
107,Bonnie Raitt,You,"Nobody else could make me happy
No one could hurt me like you do
You were the only one That mattered
Then you were gone...Love had moved on
Left me alone thinking of...
You...There was never any other
You...and I were created to be true
Isn't it Love that keeps us breathing
Isn't it love we're sent here for
Wasn't that love that we were feeling
(That was something baby)
Deep in our soul...Deeper than we know
Keeping me holding out for
You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind
You and I, we were meant to be together
True hearts in a world where love is dyin'
And I might as well have been dyin' when
We were apart
When you came back I felt the beating of my heart
You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind
You and I, we were meant to be together
You...and only you
It was you...only you

108,Bonnie Raitt,Home,"Traveling at night, the headlights were bright
And we'd been up many an hour
And all through my brain came the refrain
Of home and it's warming fire

And home sings me of sweet things
My life there has it's own wings
Fly over the mountain
Though I'm standing still

The people I've seen they come in between
The cities of tiring life
And the trains come and go but inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

And home sings me of sweet things
My life there has it's own wings
Fly over the mountain
Though I'm standing still

Traveling at night, the headlights were bright
But soon the sun came through the trees
Around the next bend the flowers will send
The sweet smell of home in the breeze
And home sings me of sweet things
My life there has it's own wings
Fly over the mountain
Though I'm standing stillEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

111,Bonnie Raitt,Louise,"They all said 'Louise was not half bad'
It was written on the walls & window shades
And how she'd act
A little girl
The deceiver, don't believe her
That's her trade
Sometimes a bottle of perfume
Flowers, and maybe some lace
Men bought Louise ten cent trinkets
Their intentions were easily traced
Everybody thought it kind of sad
When they found Louise in her room
They'd all put her down
Below their kind
Still some cried when she died
That afternoon
Louis rode home on a mail train
Somewhere to the south I heard them say
'It's too bad it ended so ugly
It's too bad she had to go that'
But the wind is blowin' cold tonight
Goodnight Louise, Goodnight
Yes, the winds' blowin' cold tonight
Goodnight Louise, good-night...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
112,Bonnie Raitt,Too Long at the Fair,"Jesus cried, wept and died
I guess He went up to heaven
I've been downtown such a long, long time
I'll never make it home by seven
Won't you come & take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore
Well I went down to Jason's
Walked 'til my feet got sore
But I never knew what laughin' was
'Til you walked out the door
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore
You can give my soul to Abraham
Give my soul to Saul
Give my bones to Canada
My teeth they don't hurt at all
I don't know who made the highway
I guess that's just my pride
But I have heard the Prince of Darkness
On his charger ride
The silver blade is gleamin'
The scales are in his hands
I swear that night is fallin'
Don't you lose another man
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
113,Bonnie Raitt,Luck of the Draw,"You dust the bottles on the bar counter
You're writing screenplays on the side
Three nights a week can keep a girl workin
Sometimes it's good to lose your pride
These things we do to keep the flame burnin
And write our fire in the sky
Another day to see the wheel turnin
Another avenue to try
It's in the Luck of the Draw, Baby
The Natural Law
Forget those movies you saw, little Baby
It's in the Luck of the Draw
The Natural Law
(flame keep on burnin)
Forget those movies you saw, little Baby
(wheel ever turnin)
You turn around and say it's last orders
You fix the ribbon in your hair
Tomorrow's letter by the hall doorway
Could be the answer to your prayersEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
114,Bonnie Raitt,Papa Come Quick (Jody And Chico),"Papa, come quick, Jody's gone to the city
What we gonna do now that Jody's gone?
She's left a note on the TV and, papa, it's a pity
What we gonna do now that Jody's gone?

Well, Mama's been cryin' in the kitchen since mornin'
She cried right through ""As The World Turns""
I seen it myself and, papa, it's a bitch'n
Let's haul ass before the baby gets burned

Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map
They got a head start, about half a day
Load up the shotgun, put it in the gun rack
Jody's with Chico down in East LA


It must've been that wild-eyed, silver-tongued schemer
A girl like Jody don't think for herself
Him and that Harley and his damn Jalapena
Smokin' that stuff'll make you hurt yourself
Papa, come quick
Papa, come quick
Papa, come quick
Papa, come on

Papa come quick, Jody's gone to the city
What we gonna do now that Jody's gone?
She left a note on the TV and Papa it's a pity
What we gonna do now that Jody's gone?

Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map
They got a head start about a half a day
Stop at the Mobil, pump up the flat wheel
Jody and Chico and his ding dang deal

Mama's been cryin' in the kitchen since mornin'
She cried right through ""As The World Turns""
I seen it myself and, papa, it's a bitch'n
Let's haul ass before the baby gets burnedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
115,Bonnie Raitt,Not the Only One,"I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
Feelin that I'd always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon
Whisperin that I wasn't the only one
The lonely one
One change intervention, see what it can signify
The slightest misapprehension, baby
And we'd have passed each other by
When I heard your sweet voice callin
Saw your light come shinin throught
I couldn't stop my heart from turning
Churnin out my love for you, my love to you
True love or perfection
It seems like it's overdue
Then just when you least expect it
It comes sneakin up on you
When I thought that I was dreamin
Felt your body close to mine
Now love takes on a different meaning
Together till the end of time
I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
Feeling that I'd always be the lonely one
When I saw your face through the web of my confusion
Whisperin that I wasn't the only one
The lonely oneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Cry on my shoulder, my love
Out in the world outside
It can be harsh and cold
But if you need someone
I will be here to hold you
Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you dry your eyes
Cry on my shoulder, my love
I know it's hard sometimes
And things seem larger than they are
But if you need to let it go
Then you can call on me
Cry on my shoulder

Cry on my shoulder, my love

I'll help you rise above

Honey, I can whip, chop and puree
I'm gonna whip you to a jelly honey
I'm gonna chop it up today
Model is so special, honey

Any recipe you use
I can whip some waffle batter
I can blend some dough for buns
And if we get done blending
We might even get some cooking done
Let me be your blender, baby
I got a cookbook all my own
I call it a thousand and one ways, baby
To make my little motor moan
Start off slow and easy, honey
I get up to a fine puree
You work those gears just right
We'll make a real love soufflé
My motor never quits
I don't know how long you're gonna last
If you don't want your cubes diced, honey

119,Bonnie Raitt,Dimming Of The Day,"This old house is falling down around my ears
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day
You pulled me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side
What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day
Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant
I see you the street and in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
120,Bonnie Raitt,Nobody’s Girl,"She don't need anybody to tell her she's pretty
She's heard it every single day of her life
He's got to wonder what she sees in him
When there's so many others standing in line
She gives herself to him, but he's still on the other side
She's alone in this world, She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl
She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night
Then she disappears for weeks at a time
Just enough to keep him wanting more
But never is he satisfied
And he's left to pick up the pieces, wondering what does he do this for
She's off in her own little world, She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl
He said ""Before I met her, I didn't love nothin.'
I could take it or leave it, that was okay, but
She brings out a want in me
For things I didn't even know that I need.""
She does anything she wants, anytime she wants to
With anyone. You know, she wants it all
Still she gets all upset over the least little thing
When you hurt her, it makes you feel so small
And she's a walking contradiction
But I ache for her inside
She's fragile like a string of pearls
She's nobody's girl
She's fragile like a string of pearls
She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

These dreams I've been dreaming
Have all fallen through
You say I'll be fine
It only takes time
Someday
That may be true
But it's too soon to tell
Ah, it's too soon to say
Maybe some day I'll be able
To wish you well
But right now it's just
Too soon to tell
It's all for the best
So you say
You never intended
To hurt me this way
You want to hear
I won't drown in my tears
Well, baby the best that I can say
Is it's too soon to tell
Ah, it's too soon to say

122,Bonnie Raitt,Give It Up or Let Me Go,"Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago
If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door
Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know
Oh honey, if you want me to love you
You've got to give it up or let me go
I know it's useless to be jealous, I couldn't tire you if I tried
But when I think of you messing behind my back
It brings a pain I just can't hide
Oh baby, I've been true to you
And if I can make that sacrifice, honey you can do it too
Well, you come home drunk and nasty, you won't tell me where you've been
Just when things are nice and sweet, you go back out again
Why do you wanna mess up a good thing?
I'm gonna find me another man, one who wants to give me everything
Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago
If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door
Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know

123,Bonnie Raitt,All at Once,"Had a fight with my daughter
She flew off in a rage
Third time this week
Don't tell me it's the age
Don't know how I lost her
I only know that it's a shame
Ever since her daddy left
The girl ain't been the same
All at once I hear your voice
And time just slips away
Nothing they could say can hold me here
Take me where I only feel
The wind across my face
Let me know there's someplace left for me
Waiting there for me
Ah, who am I kiddin'
I should have known he'd never leave
The time we spend together
Is harder than the time between
You wouldn't think it could hurt so
To see 'em out the other day
If that's what he calls leavin'
I guess I threw it all away
All at once I hear your voice
And time just slips away
Nothing they could say can hold me here
Take me where I only feel
The wind across my face
Let me know there's someplace left for me
Waiting just for me
They say women, we're the stronger
Somehow we always make it through
Hell, that ain't what I feel right now
I don't even think it's true
To me there's lots more broken
Than anyone can really see
Why the angels turn their backs on some
It's a mystery to me
All at once I hear your voice
And time just slips away
Nothing they could say can hold me here
Take me where I only feel
The wind across my face
Let me know there's someplace left for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Don't sit around gossiping

Some women nowadays
Lord they ain't no good
They will laugh in your face
Then try to steal your man from you
Women be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Your best girlfriend
She might be a highbrow
She changes clothes 3 times a day
What do you think she's doing now
While you're so far away
She's loving your man in your own damn bed
You better call for the doctor, mama
Try to investigate your head
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Don't sit around, girl
Telling all your secrets
Telling all those good things he really can do
If you talk about your baby
You tell me he's so fine

Tellin' him he's been living a lie
Over and over like a line in a song
About all the love he let pass him by
To her he might be the man of her dreams
To find what she's been hiding inside
Broken or battered it really don't matter
Her hearts like a wave and he's the tide

They're not forever, just for today
One part be my lover, one part go away

He's like a boxer who had to retire
After winning but killing a man
All of the moves and none of the courage
Afraid to throw a punch that might land
Not too much later she can't meet his glance
You see her start pulling away
Over and over like fire and ice
One is colored, one is gray

They're not forever, just for today
One part be my lover, one part go away
If you know how why don't you say 'em a prayer
They're gonna need all they help they can get
They remember too much about what went wrong
It might be they should learn to forget
Forget themselves in each other
And leave what belongs in the past
Carry their hearts like a newborn child
'Cause it's only the moment that lasts

They're not forever, just for today
One part be my lover, one part go away

One part go awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

137,Bonnie Raitt,Wah She Go Do,"I could understand why a woman must have an outside man
I could understand why a woman must have an outside man
A man just wants to run like rat and have his wife to abide by that
Every night he's havin' a ball and when he reach home he ain't touching his wife at all
And if the woman says she's feelin' sexy (Wah She Go Do)
And the man says he's feelin' sleepy (Wah She Go Do)
An she's bawlin' ""C'mon Doo doo"" but this time it soft like soft candle
No satisfaction! So you see a woman must have an outside man
If you have a husband give him plenty of position
If he starts runnin' just laugh don't say anything
If he picks up an outside woman show him you can pick up two outside men
An that's the only way a woman should get some respect today
(Wah She Go Do)
(Wah She Go Do)
Every woman they want and usin' we as a convenience
Then they turn an' say they can't trust a woman today
For days he ain't seen his home; the man goes and leaves his wife all alone
At the end when his head is bald; they go and don't know a woman never phone at all
An' if the man say ""Lie down on de bed"" (Wah She Go Do)
Then the man lays down as if he's dead (Wah She Go Do)
An she wantin' water in she tank. Yet de man so damn disobedient
No satisfaction! So you see a woman must have an outside manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
138,Bonnie Raitt,You Got To Know How,"You can make me do what you wanna do
But you got to know how
You can make me cry, you can make me sigh
But you got to know how
You can make me do like this, you can make me do like that
Woh, baby, but you got to know how
Once a pal of mine stole a guy of mine
But I got him back, now
It's the same old song, she couldn't keep him long
'Cause she didn't know how
Well, I love my man, I make him holler
Woh, my
Yessir, I really know how
Technique ain't tough, if you care enough
You can learn to know how
I might drop a hint how to strike my flint
If you yearn to know how
Well, don't tell me about the life you led
Don't try to drink me into bed
No, baby, no, that ain't the way how
You got to take your time, you know it ain't no crime
If it lasts all night
I think you'll be ideal when you begin to feel
That you're doin' right
When you love me right, you hear me holler
Woh, my
Yessir, when you really know how
And if you stay with me, who knows how it will be
When we finally know how
We'll get a house in town, no need to move around
When we really know how
Well, there's tricks that I don't even know
Ones we'll make up as we go
Woh, mister, when we really know how
Yes, mister, when we really know howEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
139,Bonnie Raitt,I Knew,"Time, time ain't never healed the wound
Can't think of anything that gets
Any better because it's old
Change, change would probably do me good
Wouldn't probably hurt a thing
Anyway, that's what I'm told

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew

Stop, stop and take a better look
There ain't no telling what you'll find
In the corner of a darkened room
Things, things that either one time fell
Or blew down from a windowsill
Or never got up by the broom

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew
No two ways about it, it's a doggone shame
Baby, it's a doggone shame

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew

140,Bonnie Raitt,Love Sneakin’ Up On You (Live),"Rainy night I'm all alone
Sitting here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold cold sweat
Thinking about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I've gotta know, do you feel the same
Do you just light up at the mention of my name

Don't worry baby
Ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
If your whole world is shakin'
And you feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you
Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneaking up on your blind side
And you might as well try and stop the rain
Or stand in the track of a runaway train
You just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be
Come on let's finish what you started with me

141,Bonnie Raitt,All Alone with Something to Say,"Like a heartbeat, timing is everything
I took a look at love when love looked away
How cruel is it that fate has to find me
All alone with something to say

I've been thinking, tweaking, and rethinking
All the things that I would tell you someday
I can hear it while I'm sitting here
All alone with something to say

I wanna tell you I love you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I should be writing a column to the people
On how not to let your love life slip away
It would be clever, witty, and titled
All alone with something to say


I wanna tell you I love you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
I'm sorry
All the nuggets of gold on my tongue
Pearls of wisdom coming in waves
How cruel is it that fate has to find me
All alone with something to say
All alone with something to sayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
142,Bonnie Raitt,Storm Warning,"Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
Winds on the coast tonight
We may get tossed tonight
Storm warning, he's made it pretty plain
He's fallin' for another, found a new lover
And he won't be back again
Can't stop a river, when it's burst its banks
I've seen the look in his eyes
He's in love and hypnotized
Time of mourning
There's already been a flood of my tears
Such a sense of loss tonight
Nought to do but ride it out
Can't stop a river when it's burst its banks
I wonder how long it's gonna take
To get over this heartbreak
Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
Winds on the coast tonight
We may get tossed tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

The brightest light that shines

Of tellin' you everything
I could never say before

Of tellin' you that every day

Of tellin' you everything
I could never say before
Yeah, this is my way
Of tellin' you that every day
I'm lovin' you so much more

If I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else
They'd only let me down

Are like the stars above Laredo
Like meat and potatoes
To me
In my sweet dreams we are
In a bar
And it's my birthday
Drinking salty marguaritas with Fernando
Young and wild
We drove 900 miles of Texas highway
To the Mexican border
As the day was comin' on
We crossed the Rio Grande River
And we swore we'd have things our way
When we happened to walk in to Nuevo Leon
Your sweet and shiny eyes
Are like the stars above Laredo
Like meat and potatoes

In my sweet dreams we are
In a bar
And it's my birthday
And we're having our picture taken

147,Bonnie Raitt,Nothing Seems to Matter,"Seems like such a long time since I held you my arms
And felt you close and warm beside me
Another night is getting late and I'm alone with just the ache
And the memory of you beside me
Darling, I've never been so blue
I've tried to see it through
There's nothing I can do
I won't make it on my own
So won't you please hurry home
'cause nothing seems to matter without you
Last time I saw you
There was nothing we could say
We knew it was a time for a change
A time to think you said that night
And I lied and said all right
I left you in the morning
I watched you in the window
And Mexico will never be the same
It was time to be apart
But somehow it seems this heart of mine
Will never find a way to live without you
And now I'm out here on the road
And I'm feeling bought and sold
And tonight I just can't but think about you
Darling, I've never been so blue
I've tried to see it through
There's nothing I can do
I won't make it on my own
So darling won't you hurry home
Because nothing seems to matter without you
No, nothing seems to matter without youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

No farewell souvenirs
Not even a token, when the spell …

149,Bonnie Raitt,Two Lives,"Maybe I'm a dreamer
Maybe just a fool
Lately I can hardly see the sun
If you had a secret I could take a guess
Nothin in your eyes seems to hold me
Truth or consequences
Which one will it be
Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But, I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart
One of us is hiding
One of us can tell
Cause no one likes to be the first to know
Someone has to answer
Cause someone has to ask
Keeping on like this is torture
And going undecided is twice as bad for sure
Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But, I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

151,Bonnie Raitt,The Ones We Couldn’t Be,"It's hard to say now who left first
It used to seem so clear
You and I were tangled from the start
Somehow the scales just fell away
And I'm left standing here
Blown open in the hole that was my part
I wrap the dark around me
There's no solace here tonight
Just wishing and regret for company
My glass is raised for all the ways
We tried to get it right
And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
I'm so sorry for the ones we couldn't be
Looking through these photographs
Searching for a clue
How you and I got tangled from the start
Not even blood could forge a bond
Enough to get us through
Or stem the tides that pulled us far apart
I'm sorry for the ways I couldn't give you
What you needed
For all the ways I strung us both along
They say it goes both ways and I suppose
I could concede it
Seems to matter more, now that you're gone
And though it seems much kinder
Just to leave some things unsaid
Like all the ways I tore myself apart
If you really want forgiveness
You better try the truth instead
It may not be enough, but it's a start
I wrap the dark around me
And there's no solace here tonight
There's just wishing and regret for company
My glass is raised for all the ways
We tried to get it right
And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
I'm so sorry for the ones
Sorry for the ones

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You didn't have to fool me
You didn't have to lie
My love comes 'ound like a thief in the night
But only love can make you cry
And we have walked side by side
Moving down that same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Your love was like a diamond ride a wave
On a sea that calms my mind
Moving onward to a distant shore
Where the boats sail in a line
We have danced to a fateful rhyme
Moving down the same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You didn't have to fool me, no
You didn't have to lie
If it all came out so ugly
It's only my love that could make you cry
And we have walked side by side
Moving down that same lonesome road
And I still don't know why

He's a short order cook
Long on speed, short on spice
He reads his customers like a book
He's seen this, and he's done that
Now he's makin' fried eggs an art
But there's one thing he can't fix no how
There's a longing in his heart
He's tried for years to work it out
At the grill and at his home
Well he talks to his friends, talks to himself
He talks the chicken right off the bone
Talks to his woman and she understands
You know they're always eye to eye
She runs the joint, they live out back
Small house under a big sky
Well even the stars at night agree
The sky is falling apart
She knows cause she can feel it too
There's a longing in her heart
A longing in her heart
Longing in her heart
Well now you and me, we're just like them
We never wanted to be alone
So we made a pact, sealed with desire
For a happier house and home
Only to find it doesn't untie
The knot where feelings die
There's a longing deep inside our hearts
And no one to tell us why
Our friends aren't looking for anything new
They wouldn't know where to look
Well her, she likes running the joint
And he likes being a cook
Together they're doing very well
They're might glad they could
But there's a fire burning towards them now
Coming from a distant wood
And even the stars at night agree
That the sky is falling apart
We know 'cause we can feel it too
There's a longing in our heartsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
155,Bonnie Raitt,Circle Dance,"I don't know why it should be so hard
Giving up this circle dance
Worn out steps from long ago
Don't give love a chance
It's a bitter heirloom handed down
These twisted parts we play
I'm not her and you're not him
It just comes out that way
Can't go back to make things right
Though I wish I understood
Time has made things clearer now
We did the best we could
I'll be home soon, that's what you'd say
And a little kid believes
After a while I learned that love
Must be a thing that leaves
I tried so hard just to hold you near
Was as good as I could be
Even when I had you here
You stayed so far from me
Can't go back to make things right
Though I wish I understood
Time has made things clearer noe
You did the best you could
Now that this has occured to me
I just want you to know
I've been too faithful all my life
It's time to let you goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
156,Bonnie Raitt,Matters Of The Heart,"Broken heart, bloodshot stare
Signs of a fool who cared too much
Now she's gone and he can't remember how
To live without her touch
Hopin' to die but surely livin' to tell
When it comes to matters of the heart
There is nothing a fool won't get used to
So he found someone afraid his heart would follow the heat
He could hardly do more than pretend
Though she knew in her heart that his love was alive
When it comes to matters of the heart
There is nothing a fool won't get used to
Now of all the things love teaches
All the ways that it opens our eyes
None more profound than the lesson he learned
The day she walked out of his life
Well when the road gets too narrow
It's then he remembers her smile
And he sees these words forming on her lips
Across a river of tears he once cried
When it comes to matters of the heart
There is nothing a fool won't get used toEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word
A bad enough situation
Is sure enough getting worse
Everybody's crying justice
Just as soon as there's business first
Toe to toe, touch and go
Give a cheer and get your own souvenir
Well you know the people running round in circles
Don't know what they're headed for
Everybody's crying peace on earth
Just as soon as we win this war
Straight ahead, gotta knock em dead
So pack your kit, choose your own hypocrite
You don't have to go to off-Broadway
To see something plain absurd
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word
Nobody knows the meaning of the wordEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
160,Bonnie Raitt,Under the Falling Sky,"Warm and lovely mystery, fire smiling through
Before this moment fades away I want to know you
I've got lightening in my pocket, thunder in my shoe
Have no fear I've got something here I want to show you
Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you
It's a low road, a high wire going from me to you
And in your eyes the distance left is closing
I've got a feeling in my oceans
Blood underneath my skin
That into your bright fields this prison is opening
Our shadows wake each day though they don't know why
They hope and try -- live and die
So leave them in their frozen world
Come and be my lover
If only for one stolen moment
We will live forever
Warm and lovely mystery, can you hear the choir?
Voices can no longer hold my desire
Just abandon your sad history and meet me in the fire
Angels wait to take me higher and higher
Higher and higherEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Can't get no rest, got no peace of mind
You say you gave your heart to me
You put me down you set me free
You said you're deadly, everybody said you was deadly
I guess you know he is because, deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Always takes you by surprise
You said you was the only one
Coming on me and ruining my fun
Leave me setting at home all alone
Waitin' on your call by the telephone
You said you're deadly, everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you always was deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Finally made me realize
That I tried and tried, but you just can't get enough
So you lied and lied and lied and lied
I will not be denied, I'm gonna plant a seed
I will not be denied, of the man and the love I need
Said you're deadly, everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you are because, deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Always takes you by surprise
It's a sad situation when yes its true
I can say it baby I'm through with you
It's over now and in the past
Gonna find me a man with a love that'll last
You know he's deadly, everybody said you were deadly
Guess you know you always been deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Finally made me realize
That I tried and tried, but you just couldn't get enough
And so you lied and lied and lied and lied
And I will not be denied, will not be denied
Of the love I'll be there, will not be denied
I said I will not be, will not be denied
No not be denied I, I will not be denied
I tell it one more time, will not be yeah, will not be denied
Will not be denied, will not be deniedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
162,Bonnie Raitt,The Road’s My Middle Name,"I told you once the day we met
I wouldn't be your queen
Your little darlin', sweet coquette
Just what my routine
You've been around enough to know
There's really no one else
When I hear that siren call, baby
I just can't help myself
I gotta go
I hope you'll understand
I love you so
Want you to be my man
I hear it callin'
Sound so sweet and plain
I gotta go, baby
'Cause the road's my middle name
Well, it's hard enough to love someone
When they're right close to home
Don't you think I know it's hard, honey
To squeeze the sugar from the phone
Guess the road is in my blood
'Cause I'm my daddy's kid
Just have to learn how to let me go
Just like my momma did
I gotta go
I hope you'll understand
Oh, I love you so
Want you to be my man
I hear it callin', baby
Sound so sweet and plain
I gotta go
'Cause the road's my middle name
Here it come
And it sounds so sweet and plain
I gotta go
'Cause the road's my middle name
I gotta go
'Cause the road's my middle name
Oooh, I gotta go, darlin'
'Cause the road's my middle nameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
163,Bonnie Raitt,Bluebird,"Listen to my blue bird laugh, she can tell you why
Deep within her heart you see, she knows only right, whoa-oh just light
There she sits a lofty bird, the strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now, she thinks only of you, woo just you
So get all those blues, must be a thousand hues
And each is differently used you just know
You sit there mesmerized by the depth of her eyes
If you categorize she got soul, she got soul, she got soul
Soon she's gon' to fly away, her sadness is her own
Leave beside her bath of tears, she'll go home, going home
Going home, going home, going home, going home
Going home, going home, going home, going homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
164,Bonnie Raitt,That Song About The Midway,"I met you on a midaway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses
You were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like the devil wearing wings
Wearing wings, you looked so grand, wearing wings
Do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly? I hear you can! Can you fly?
Just like an eagle doin' his hunting from the sky
I followed through a sideshow to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, shootin' out the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice
Once or twice, I heard ya did, once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Now you've packed it in, I heard you did, packed it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win?
Lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
The man calls out the numbers...he sometimes mentions mine
But I feel like I've been working overtime
Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
165,Bonnie Raitt,I Ain’t Blue,"I ain't blue, baby
Just a little bit lonesome for some lovin'
Everything is fine
Just don't want to be all by myself
On a rainy day
I'm feelin' kind of funny
Dreaming 'bout some loverman who'll call me honey
Yeah and a good lookin' man
My heart inside
A lonely smile and lovin' in his eyes
No I ain't blue, baby
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again
Everything is fine
Just don't want to be all by myself
Sit around the house
Readin' magazines
All the time thinkin' 'bout those same sweet dreams
Yeah, walk down the street
My heart jumps a beat
Every time I see some sweet man I want to meet
No I ain't blue, baby
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again
Everything is fine
I just don't want to be all by myselfEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
166,Bonnie Raitt,Come to Me,"All I ever wanted was our love to be true
More than just enough to get me by
I want a love to see me through
I don't need another well-spent night
Another clever sideways glance
I wanna look my baby in the eye
And know there's nothing left to chance
Well if you're tired of being lonely, beat up and confused
Darling, there's only one thing you can do:

Who'll give me fire and tenderness
And has got the guts to stick around
Well if you're tired of being lonely, beat up and confused
Darling, there's only one thing you can-

168,Bonnie Raitt,Any Day Woman,"If you don't love her, you'd better let her go
You'll never fool her, you're bound to let it show
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake everything in return
You just preserve her when you serve her a little tenderness
If she's a woman she'll try to make it last
If you're a man now, you'd better to end it fast
There's no reason here, no treason here, just the way of a woman's mind
She has no blame, she has no shame, she just loves you
It's not easy to undo what's done
Or to speak too freely to just anyone
And if this takes more than you've bargained form, Boy it's time you learned
Not to talk so loud or walk so proud
When you're comin' onEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
169,Bonnie Raitt,Shake A Little,"In the shadow of your father
Sweet brown eyes of the one I love
I can't wait another minute baby
To do the things that we never done
Everybody gets hungry sometimes
Your love is like a kettle on
In the shadow of your father
Guess I get a little sad sometimes
Shake a little for me baby
Take me to the water when my well runs dry
Shake a little for me baby
Just a little now
Just a little now
Everybody gets lonely sometimes
Guess a stranger is a friend in need
In the shadow of this New York skyline
All these stories looking down on me
Everybody feels the water rising
Could go on to her enjoy the ride
Ah when you're dancing for me now baby
I don't feel so small against the tide
Shake a little for me baby
Take me to the water when my well runs dry
Shake a little for me baby
Shake a little for me baby
Take me to the water when my cup runs dry
Shake a little for me baby

Come bravely to me
Let your heart be still
For our time
Has come my tender one
To be free of will
And fly
Blind on fearless love
Let them wild winds blow
We'll shine
On all we're fearful of
Then we'll let it go
Let it go
Skippin' stones
Across the great unknown
Safe at water's edge
Don't look down, baby
We're gonna leave this losin' town
(and) leap out from the ledge
And fly
Blind on fearless love
Let them wild winds blow
We'll shine
On all we're fearful of
Then we'll let it go

I can see it in your hair
But I can't bear to breathe it in somehow
I'll rise and fall with you
'Cause you can't fail me now
I'll rise and fall with you
'Cause you can't fail me now
Salty sweet upon my mouth
And dark throws sparks against my house
The stain of love's a smudge upon my brow
But you see through me
And you can't fail me now
You see right through me
You can't fail me now
Bit off more than I can chew
Somethin' that I tend to do
But fewer words are what we need and how
You bite my tongue
You can't fail me now
I rant and rail
Oh, you can't fail me now
I lost the thread among the vines
And hung myself in storylines
That tell a tale I never would allow
God knows the name of every bird
It fills my mind like angry words
That you know all my secret heart avows
We're taught to love the worst of us
Mercy more than life but, trust me
Mercy's just a warnin' shot across the bow
I live for yours
And you can't fail me now
I live for your mercy
You can't fail me now
You can't fail me nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Lately seems like all we ever do
Can't remember when things got so crazy
All I know is I don't know what to do
I guess we oughta stop and think it over
Decide if what we want there's enough of
It's tearing us apart, it cuts right through the heart
It's an unintended consequence of love

Remember how we fell into each other, baby
Was all we could do to get up out of bed
You used to say nobody loved you better
I used to hang on every word you said
What happened to those brave and tender lovers?
How could we break the mighty promise of?
I guess time wore us down, expectations run aground
It's an unintended consequence of love

Now baby, I'm the one that's taking chances
I know we've got a love worth fighting for
Let's drop them petty games and pick up dancing
Get back to where we're wanting nothing more, woo
I'm calling on you, baby, now or never
Let's dig in deep and get out of this rut
We'll get back to what brought us both together, baby
Find a way to resurrect our strut
'Cause baby, you're my brave and tender lover
I know we'll find the mighty promise of

We'll get this love on track

He just takes his time
Just a little taste is all it takes to make him mine

Like their men will never come to no good
You know they are always on the cheat
And never treat him like a good woman should
You want him to do you right
Honey, that ain’t the way
You got to love him all night
You do just what he say
And you get just what you give out
That's the only way to gain his faith
Now me and my baby
We always know just what we're puttin' down
And we know we'll be together
Til the day when something better comes around
Til that day comes

Your dreams won't happen unless you only want them to

I thought I had nothin' left to lose
Where'd you say you'd be tonight
Streetlights are all I see
All I wanted on that ride
Was just a little kindness, a little kindness shown my way
I found myself runnin' out of ideas on how to say
It just got to be somethin' more than I could take
But that summer somehow we were havin' fun
Your magic took me by surprise
Where'd you say you'd be tonight

When will I see that you belong to me
Sweet Forgiveness
How could go my way (?)
I never really knew how I needed you, but you were right there
(I dont't know the rest)
Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me
When you hold me close
And you say: ""That's all over.""
You don't go looking back
You don't hold the cards to stack
'Cause you mean what you say
Sweet forgiveness, you help me see
I'm not near as bad
As I sometimes appear to be
When you hold me close
And you say: ""That's all over
""And I still love you.""
There's no way that I could make up
For those angry words I said
Sometimes it gets to hurting
And the pain goes to my head
Sweet forgiveness, dear God above
I say we all deserve
A taste of this kind of love
Someone who'll hold our hand
And whisper: ""I understand
""And I still love you.""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

186,Bonnie Raitt,Steal Your Heart Away,"I know you got a different picture in mind
Some dream a world of a different kind
I know this rhythm we've been moving to is way to slow
Each time our bodies are supposed to meet
I'm here still missing a beat
And when I look at you in your eyes
We're still dancing to a different tune
Take me to your dreaming place (chorus)
And open up my eyes
Let me see what it takes to be
Your lover in disguise
Show me how I do those things
That make you want to stay
'Cause I'll go crazy if I don't find
The words I gotta say
To steal your heart away
I'll buy you diamonds, golden rings baby
All kinds of beautiful things
But that don't matter to a lover with a restless heart, no no baby
Cause you still want to wake up to a different scene
Some screen gem like the one in your dream
And leave me standing like a fool in the wings
Still waiting for a part to play
(Chorus)
I know you think she's right for you
That she's in tune with what you do
That she can touch you deep inside
Where all your deepest feelings lie
But I got something you should know
Before she starts to hurt you so
You can bet your life she's gonna hurt you
And maybe you think that it's alright
To leave me waiting every night
To put me down in company
In front of everyone we see
To take my loving when it's free
And then to throw it back at me
Well baby, I just can't stand it
Cause I can be the one for you
And I can make your dreams come true
And I can love you like she can
Cause fancy clothes don't make no woman
Believe me baby
I got what it takes to make you feel
And maybe you think a girl should be
As perfect as a girl can be
To love you when your feeling down
And miss you when you're not around
Well I can't be that one for you
I can only be the one that loves you
Hey, what's this on your mind
Hey, what's this change og mind
Hey what's this on your mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
187,Bonnie Raitt,Take My Love With You,"Daylight I think about you
And wonder where you are
At night I'm wishin'
Lookin' at the stars
But I don't worry 'bout you
I know that soon you'll be home
But while you're gone
Take my love with you
Let it be the light that sees you through
Chase away your blues
Where you go and what you do
Take my love with you

I'll be your lucky charm

Put it in your heart
And in your weakness, baby

188,Bonnie Raitt,Wherever You May Be,"As simple as breathing, I picture your face
All tangled in daydreams, and she'll live with grace
I feel you beside me, again
Wherever you may be
Lift up your head for me
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you
If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out
Across the wilderness, from me to you
Certain as sunrise, your image unwinds
Your clearer than crystal, you fill up my mind
Now I have you by my side
Wherever you may be
Lift up your head for me
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you
Though continents divide, and lonely thoughts collide
All heaven will allow, no distance now
I can always close my eyes, take your abstance by surprise
Hold my breath and make peace

189,Bonnie Raitt,My Opening Farewell,"A lady stands before an open window
Looking so far away
She can almost feel the southern winds blow
Gently touching his restless day
He turns from his window to me
Sad smile his apology
Sad eyes reaching to the door
Daylight loses to another evening
Still he spares me words goodbye
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry
Suddenly it's so hard to find
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind
So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind
There's a train every day
Leading either way
There's a world you know
There's a way to go
I soon believe it's just as well
This is my opening farewell
A child's drawings left there on the table
And a woman's silk is lying on the floor
I would keep them here if I were able
To lock you safe behind it's open door
Suddenly it's so clear to me
That I'd ask you to see what you may never see
Now my kind words find their way back to me
There's a train every day
Leading either way
There's world you know
Got a way to go
I soon believe it's just as well
This is my opening farewell
This is my opening farewellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
190,Bonnie Raitt,What Is Success,"How does one decide
That the methods he's using
They just don't jive
To truly believe and keep trying
Over and over again
Living in hopes
That someday you'll be in with the winners
When will one change his mind
And jump the fence
For the dial a sign
Its a sad thing, its a bad thing
But so necessary
Living in hopes
That someday you'll be in with the winners
Now what, what, (I don't know, can you tell me what)
What is success?
Is it do your own thing?
Or to join the rest
And if you truly believe it
And try over and over again
Living in hopes
That someday you'll be in with the winners
Oooh, tell me what it is
Sweet success
Oooh, tell me what it is
Sweet successEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

192,Bonnie Raitt,Rainy Day Man,"What good is that happy lie
All you wanted from the start was to cry
Well it looks like another fall
My friends they don't help at all
And I'm feeling kind of cold and small
Think I'll look up my rainy day man
And it does me no good to pretend
When he's made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like I lose again my friend
Guess I'll have to look up my rainy day man
Rainy day man
He don't like sunshine
Don't chase rainbows
He don't need good times
Grey days roll in
And then you'll see him
It's an empty feelin'
Now I need him
All those noble thoughts they don't belong
If you can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since I knew where I stood all along
Think I'll look up my rainy day man
Simple pleasures all evade you
And the store-bought treasures none can save you
Look for signs to ease the pain
I said, ask again
Why don't you pray for rain
Oh, it looks like another fall
And my friends they don't help at all
And I'm feeling kind of cold and small
Think I'll look up my rainy day man
All I have to do is look at my baby
Look up my rainy day man
Oooo, look up my rainy day man
All I have to do
Is look up my rainy day man...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

When there's no one else around

In this love that I've found
Hey baby
See how it can be
Every time you reveal yourself tome
I'll come runnin'
I want to feel myself go under,baby
Where the deepest river bleeds
I want to feel it pull me under,darlin'

194,Bonnie Raitt,Since I Fell For You,"When you just give love, and never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and still I know
I can't get you out of my heart
You made me leave my happy home
You took my love, and now you've gone
Since I fell for you ...
My life has been such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you ...
Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you ...
When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you
I guess I'll never see the light
I get these blues most every night
Since I fell for you ...
Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you...
When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you
I guess I'll never see the light
I get those blues most every night

Since you loved me, then you snubbed me
I prayed you put no one above me

195,Bonnie Raitt,My First Night Alone Without You,"There is an aching in my head
From the bed I can't get used to
It's these little hours in the dark, I dread
As I spend my first night alone without you
Honey, half of me has gone away
With all the love I learned to cling to
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way
To live the rest of my life alone without you
You taught me how to live
How to be myself
And how to give
Oh, but now it's you
Who's given up on giving
You've lost the thing, no one to teach
Changing and now you're out of reach
And my life tonight just don't seem worth living
No, no
I've been sitting learning how to read
Cause back in school I never liked to
It's just one of those little things I'm gonna need
As I put my life together, baby, without youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
196,Johnny Cash,You Are My Sunshine,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
"
197,Johnny Cash,Hurt,"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
"
198,Johnny Cash,Ring of Fire,"Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire


I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

199,Johnny Cash,I Walk The Line,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

200,Johnny Cash,Folsom Prison Blues,"I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay

201,Johnny Cash,Jackson,"We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm going to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care

When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow (Hah)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
""Goodbye,"" that's all she wrote

But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, I'll go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Japan Fan
Well now, We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper Sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back

202,Johnny Cash,The Man Comes Around,"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see."" And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going 'round taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
Till Armageddon no salaam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around
"
203,Johnny Cash,Cocaine Blues (At Folsom Prison),"Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Late in the hot joints taking the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down, because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more""
When I was arrested I was dressed in black,
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court""
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, in the first degree
I hollered, ""Lawdy, Lawdy, have mercy on me""
The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey, and let that cocaine be

"
204,Johnny Cash,God’s Gonna Cut You Down,"You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will!""

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut you down
Tell them that God's gonna cut you down
"
205,Johnny Cash,A Boy Named Sue,"""I want you to, if you don't mind, Carl, I'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs, play the guitar.""
""I'd love to!""
""One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?""

Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must've thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
"
206,Johnny Cash,Man in Black,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the time
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
"
207,Johnny Cash,I’ve Been Everywhere,"I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with a high an' canvas covered load
""If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride""

I've been everywhere, man
Crossed the desert's bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I've a-had my share, man
I've been everywhere
I've been to Pittsburgh, Parkersburg, Gravelbourg, Colorado
Ellensburg, Rexburg, Vicksburg, El Dorado
Larimore, Admore, Haverstraw, Chatanika
Chaska, Nebraska, Alaska, Opelaka
Baraboo, Waterloo, Kalamazoo, Kansas City
Sioux City, Cedar City, Dodge City, what a pity

208,Johnny Cash,One,"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

You said one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again

You say love is a temple, love the higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

209,Johnny Cash,Ain’t No Grave (Gonna Hold This Body Down),"There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

When I hear that trumpet sound
I'm going to rise right out of the ground
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Well, look way down the river
And what do you think I see
I see a band of angels
And they're coming after me

Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

Well, look down yonder, Gabriel
Put your feet on the land and sea
But Gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet
Until you hear from me
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

Well meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings don't fail me
I will meet you anywhere

Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

Well meet me, Mother and Father
Meet me down the river road
And Mama, you know that I'll be there
When I check in my load

Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave

210,Johnny Cash,I Won’t Back Down,"Well I won't back down, no I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
Going to stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down
Going to stand my ground and I won't back down

Hey baby, there is no easy way out
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down

Well I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground and I won't back down

211,Johnny Cash,Cry! Cry! Cry!,"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye!""
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me: ""Why, why, why?""
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been

212,Johnny Cash,Heart of Gold,"I want to live
I want to give

I never give
That keeps me searching

And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean
For a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
That keeps me searching

You keep me searching

213,Johnny Cash,I Still Miss Someone,"At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere

214,Johnny Cash,The Long Black Veil,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The Judge said, ""Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
Now the scaffold seemed high, and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd, but she shed not a tear
But some times at night when the cold wind calls
She comes to my grave and she moans o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows, nobody sees

215,Johnny Cash,Ghost Riders in the Sky,"An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy drawl
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on, hear their cry
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell from ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies""
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

216,Johnny Cash,I Hung My Head,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
""Why had I run?""
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find""
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my
Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head

Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby

If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you

I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you

Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow
If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining?

Would you still love me?

I'd answered you, ""Yes I would""
And would you not be above me

218,Johnny Cash,Wayfaring Stranger,"I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
There's no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go

I'm going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who've gone on

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep

I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come

So, I'm just going over Jordan

219,Johnny Cash,Big River,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called
Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River

220,Johnny Cash,Further On (Up the Road),"Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
I'll meet you further on up the road
Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing
I got a song to sing, it keeps me out of the cold
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Where the way is dark and the night is cold
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul

Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know

That charges through the night
Like an orange bolt of lightning
Passing everything in sight

I'm thunder on the highway looking bad, bad, bad
I'm a knight
Like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
I'm a fighter and a charmer
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My friends all know me as the General Lee
I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
We'll cross the field and we'll be runnin' free
They'll eat dust with compliments of me
The General Lee
I'm a hero
And that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
I'm glory bound and when the chase is done
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun
I've got style
Tearing through the curves
With my flag waving proudly to the people that I serve
I'm number 1 and I'll always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee
I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free
And they'll go swimming compliments of me

222,Johnny Cash,I See a Darkness,"Well, you're my friend
And can you see
Many times we've been out drinking
Many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got?
Well, you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live, I won't let go
But can you see its opposition
Comes rising up sometimes?
That its dreadful and position
Comes blacking in my mind

And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

Well, I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?

223,Johnny Cash,Cocaine Blues (live),"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joints takin' the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Said yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Up then he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack - into that district court""
Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, ""Lawdy Lawdy, have mercy on me""
The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
99 years in the Folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine beEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
224,Johnny Cash,One Piece at a Time,"Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit working on assembly line
The first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
Because I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'd know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox, and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, and bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now my plan went all right
Until we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an a-daptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
Because to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around

Uh, yeah, Red Ryder?
This is the Cotton Mouth
In the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, come on
Huh? This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mo-chine, there, Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?
Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58, '59 automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67

225,Johnny Cash,She Used to Love Me a Lot,"I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot
She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in and I'd give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot
I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said ""where have you been? It's been a while""
She was glad to see me, I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said ""it's not too late to start again
We could spend the night together, take up where we left off""
She used to love me a lot
But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
""Yes I'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot""

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there, I've never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot

Well I'm waiting on the pardon that'll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this ain't the movies so forget about me
With 8 more minutes to go
With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose
5 more minutes to go
Won't somebody come and cut me loose
7 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains I can see the skies

1 more minute to go

229,Johnny Cash,Don’t Take Your Guns to Town,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill

He said, ""I'm sorry to tell you but your body's outlived your brain""
He said, ""I know this doctor in New York son
And he'll fix you up right with a brand new one""
So the head doctor met me when I stepped down off the train
He said, ""We had this bank robber killed last night
His body's shot but his brain's alright
I'll give you a transplant boy, and it'll be okay""
I got my new brain in and I was feeling great
I went right back to Nashville with no headache
But something strange happened when I walked in the bank one day
I said ""Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, ""Why, you're Johnny Cash!""
I said, ""No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York""
Now the other night, Roy Acuff called me
He said, ""John, I'd like for you to do the Opry""
So I went out on the stage, but I couldn't sing
I got into half a verse of ""I Walk The Line""
And something snapped in that head of mine
I yelled, ""Stick 'em up! Gimme your money, your watches, and rings""
Well I called New York and talked to that brain quack
I said, ""Doc, I've got to have my old brain back""
He said, ""I'm sorry there Mr. Cash, but I can't do that""
He said, ""I put your brain in a chicken last Monday
He singing your songs and making lots of money
And I got him signed to a ten year recording contract""
Now friends, if you see me walking down the street
Remember what you see ain't necessarily me
And if I try to hold you up, don't pay me no mind
But when you got ten bucks that you can blow
You ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
He's doin' fairs and concert dates all up and down the line
I said ""Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, ""Why, you're Johnny Cash!""
I said, ""No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York""

Well, I don't pay any income tax
You don't pay tax on money you steal
But you ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
Chicken In Black

231,Johnny Cash,Get Rhythm,"Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

A little shoeshine boy he never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
He popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all your trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was going to jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
But does a million dollars worth of good for you

232,Johnny Cash,The Wreck of the Old ’97,"They gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Saying Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
You must put her into Spencer on time
He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
""Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Old Mountain
Watch old 97 roll""
And then a telegram came to Washington station
This is how it read:
It said, ""That brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying down in Danville, dead""
He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Don't you speak hard words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never returnEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
233,Johnny Cash,Personal Jesus,"Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares

Someone to hear your prayers
Someone to care
Feeling unknown

234,Johnny Cash,It Ain’t Me Babe,"Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

You say you're looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothing more

235,Johnny Cash,Dark as the Dungeon (At Folsom Prison),"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Until the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day...
(Ha ha, no laughing during this song please... It's being recorded, I know. Hell, don't you know it's being recorded?)
...Like a friend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
""Thank you very much, thank you very much. I'm sorry about that little interruption there, but I just want to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records and you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that.

236,Johnny Cash,Ragged Old Flag,"I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sitting there
I said ""Your old court house is kind of run down""
He said ""Naw, it'll do for our little town""
I said ""Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit""
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
He said ""Have a seat"", and I sat down
""Is this the first time you've been to our little town?""
I said ""I think it is""
He said ""I don't like to brag, but we're kind of proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
And It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
Writing Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
Tugging at its seams
And It almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
By her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
And now they've about quit waving back here at home
In her own good land here She's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearing thin
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in
Because she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more""
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We don't let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
I do like to brag
Because  I'm mighty proud of

237,Johnny Cash,Give My Love to Rose,"I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
Because it ain't right that she should live alone
Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him

238,Johnny Cash,The Ballad of Ira Hayes,"Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira Hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance?
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty

239,Johnny Cash,Solitary Man,"Belinda was mine until the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim
And loving him
Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought
Me and Sue
But that died, too

Don't know that I will but until I can find me
A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man

I've had it to here - being where love's a small word
A part time thing
A paper ring
I know it's been done having one girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong


Don't know that I will but until love can find me
And a girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man

Don't know where

Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away

"
241,Johnny Cash,The Mercy Seat,"It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row
A crime for which I am totally innocent, you know

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die
I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
My kill-hand's
Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hopin'
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to loose
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
242,Johnny Cash,Rock Island Line,"Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said

I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all livestock

Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started picking up a little bit of speed
Picking up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said

Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got all pigiron

A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

245,Johnny Cash,The Junkie’s Prayer,"That bed that I lay on is narrow and cold
This sickness inside me tears at my soul
And the devil awaits me, he calls me his son
For he knows I'm cornered and too weak to run
For I soon must return to my gutter of thrills
Where joy is the needle or a bottle of pills
Where a man welcomes misery like an old friend from home
That he uses and abuses till the misery is gone
My mind's filled with torture my body's in pain
But the needle is warm as it sinks in my vein
Just a matter of seconds then my mind will be free
From the coldness and darkness that dominate me
But the freedom is short lived and then I'm alone
I must find the pusher but my money's all gone
Then the cycle of horror starts over once more
Oh God, let me suffer this misery no moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
246,Johnny Cash,Streets of Laredo,"As I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
""Come and sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die""
""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card-house and then down to Rose's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall""
""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong""
""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother
And tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on""
When this he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker we made to this day
We beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, lay the sod over him

247,Johnny Cash,Danny Boy,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses fallin'
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide
But come yet back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so
But if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""ave"" there for me
And I will know, though soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me

It's none of my business how you feel about some other things, and I don't give a damn about how you feel about some other things. But anyway, I tried to put myself in your place, and I believe this is how I would feel about San Quentin...""

San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why

San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman, you can't understand

San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin, you've been living hell to me

Restless by day and by night rants and rages at the stars
God help the beast in me
The beast in me has had to learn to live with pain
And how to shelter from the rain
And in the twinkling of an eye, might have to be restrained
God help the beast in me
Sometimes it tries to kid me
That it's just a teddy bear
And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
And that is when I must beware of the beast in me
That everybody knows
They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
Patently unclear if it's New York or New Year

250,Johnny Cash,Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk

251,Johnny Cash,The Wanderer,"I went out walking through the streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

I went out with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went out walking
Down that winding road
Where no one's trusting no one
And conscience a too heavy load
I went out riding, down that ol'eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name


I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there, too
Looking for you
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel's as much
As a man can before he repents
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who could sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yea I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon
Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wanderingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
252,Johnny Cash,Orange Blossom Special,"Look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back

Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues

""Say man, when you going back to Florida?""
""When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will.""
""Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?""
""Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die.""

Hey talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a-travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special

253,Johnny Cash,Daddy Sang Bass,"I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

254,Johnny Cash,Ballad of a Teenage Queen,"(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)

There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you
(How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung around her by the score
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)

She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen
(Not a care, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(You should be a movie queen)
He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out
(Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door
Working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(See you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town
(But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train
(Left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Now this story has some more

255,Johnny Cash,The One on the Right Is on the Left,"There once was a musical troupe
A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist
This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all
Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, ""Oh dear""
Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself
Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
"
256,Johnny Cash,Redemption Day,"I've wept for those who suffer long
But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killing
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television
Come leaders, come you men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening
There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
On why we waited until so late
Was there no oil to excavate
No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

It's buried in the countryside
It's exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries
Freedom
Freedom

257,Johnny Cash,In My Life,"There are places I'll remember
All my life
Though some have changed
Some forever
Not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one
Compares with you
And these memories
Lose their meaning
When I think of love
As something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
In my life

258,Johnny Cash,My Grandfather’s Clock,"My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man diedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
259,Johnny Cash,A Thing Called Love,"Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about
A little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found

260,Johnny Cash,Big Iron,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
He was an Arizona Ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
Was about to meet his death
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hipEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
261,Johnny Cash,Guess Things Happen That Way,"Well you ask me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
And have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another

I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

Then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
And have the strength to stand alone

262,Johnny Cash,I Was There When It Happened,"There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (Peace within)

Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm going to shout it (I'm going to shout it)
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (Peace within)
Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)

263,Johnny Cash,The Lily of the Valley,"I have found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He's the Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay
And He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He will never, never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
There's a wall of fire about me and I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill
And then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star

264,Johnny Cash,Hey Porter,"Hey porter, hey porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be 'til we cross
That Mason-Dixon Line?
At daylight, would ya tell that engineer
To slow it down?
Or better still, just stop the train
'cause I want to look around

Hey porter, hey porter!
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be 'til I
Can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie, will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell?
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
To stand right up and yell

Hey porter, hey porter!
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffing smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he
Will blow his whistle please
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze
Hey porter, hey porter!
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make
That lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
So take it easy on the steam


Hey porter, hey porter!
Please open up the door
When they stop the train, I'm gonna get off first
'cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks a lot
And I didn't mind the fare
I'm going to set my feet on Southern soil

265,Johnny Cash,Father and Son,"It's not time to make a change
Just relax and take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, the same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
There's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
All the times that I cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree
But it's them you know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away

266,Johnny Cash,The Legend of John Henry’s Hammer,"John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy
Said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to
John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line
Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?
And he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy?)
I can I'll do anything you hire me to
Now ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer
He said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do
With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel
(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel
Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring
But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you
John Henry said I feed four little brothers, and my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam
John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill
John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man
There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you
2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend
Captain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills
Well John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it
Take my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, ain't no machine can, that's been proved to you

267,Johnny Cash,What Is Truth,"The old man turned off the radio
Said, ""Where did all of the old songs go?""
""Kids sure play funny music these days!""
""They play it in the strangest ways.""
Said, ""It looks to me like they've all gone wild.""
""It was peaceful back when I was a child""
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries
""What is truth?""

A little boy of three sitting on the floor
Looks up and says, ""Daddy, what is war?""
""Son, that's when people fight and die.""
The little boy of three says, ""Daddy, why?""
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school
Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking
""What is truth?""
A young man sitting on the witness stand
The man with the book says - ""Raise your hand!""
""Repeat after me, I solemnly swear""
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries
""What is truth?""

The young girl dancing to the latest beat
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while
This old world's waking to a new born day
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way
You better help the voice of youth find
What is truth?
And the lonely voice of youth cries

268,Johnny Cash,Tennessee Stud,"Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
Drifted on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foe
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
I rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee mare
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing 'round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee studEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks number 8
I've always done an honest job, honest as I could
Got a brother named Frankie, Frankie isn't no good
Ever since we were young kids, it's been the same come down
I'd get a call on the short wave, Frankie's in trouble downtown
Well, if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But sometimes when it's your brother, you look the other way

Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played ""The Night of the Johnstown Flood""
I catch him when he's straying, like any brother should
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good

Well, Frankie went into the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping, until it was like we's getting robbed
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job

Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played ""The Night of the Johnstown Flood""
I catch him when he's straying, teach him how to walk that line
Man turns his back on his family, ain't no friend of mine
The night was like any other, I got a call about a quarter to nine
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid on the floor, looking bad, bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table, it was Frankie, she said
I ran out and I jumped in my car, then I hit the lights
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night
It was down by the crossroads, out by willow bank
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank
Well, I chased him through them county roads, until the sign said Canadian border five miles from here
Pulled over to the side out the highway, watched the taillights disappear

Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played ""The Night of the Johnstown Flood""

270,Johnny Cash,I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low

I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a Robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost his will to live

I'm so lonesome I could cry


The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

271,Johnny Cash,Desperado,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You been out riding fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you aren't getting any younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Isn't it funny how the feeling
Goes away
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be raining, but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
"
272,Johnny Cash,The Wall,"There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Namin' their wedding day
Namin' their wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm going to be the first
I'm going to be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide

273,Johnny Cash,Bridge over Troubled Water,"When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls, so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come, to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine
Oh, If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
"
274,Johnny Cash,Out Among the Stars,"It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closing time another day is done
When a boy walked in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job, but Lord, he's found a gun
He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
Then he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel a great relief

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?
The evening news carried all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries, he'll never live this down

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

276,Johnny Cash,Devil’s Right Hand,"Well, about the time my daddy left to fight the big war
Saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
I asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs and she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
My very first pistol was a cap-and-ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
It loads a mite slow and I soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
Then I went and bought myself a Colt .45
Called a Peacemaker but I didn't know why
I never knew why and I didn't understand
'Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
I never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating and I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right handEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

If I hadn't have shot poor
Delia I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there found her in her parlor
And I tied to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot her I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer
I can't sleep 'cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her

278,Johnny Cash,It’s All Over,"I was on my way to you and I was worried
I was all torn up and nervous cause I knew that you'd be gone
I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go
I'd been runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
I was broken in a million little pieces
When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go, let her go, boy
Let her goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
279,Johnny Cash,First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless sky, my love
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move through my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I know our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love

281,Johnny Cash,If I Told You Who It Was,"I was down in music city 'bout a week ago
I wanted to see the brand old Loper show
So I held a cap and I headed down to Opryland
They said they sold their last ticket the day before
So I kinda just hung around the backstage door
And down the steps she came, man oh man
My favourite female country star
She waved her fans and headed for her car
Her tire, unlike her body, was very flat
She said, could you change my tire
I said your wish is my desire
As she raised the lid, I grabbed her bumper jack
She said I sure do appreciate you changing my tire

If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

She said you need a lift and I said well
You can drop me of at the York motel
So we headed down Briley parkway in the town
I told her I got all your records ma'am
She smiled and said well I be damned
She said, you're kind of cute fella, wanna mess around
When we got to my room just the people lied
I said sure wish I could've heard you sing tonight
She smiled at me and said what do you wanna hear?
Well if I was one of them country music folks
I'll tell you, she'd sure get my vote for the best performance of the year
If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

Well I tell you this much
When I put my arms around her and squeezed her real tight
She looked up at me with those big beautiful eyes
Took a deep breath and a sigh and said:
""Howdy I'm just so proud to be here!""

If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines

I'm gonna keep it

282,Johnny Cash,Folsom Prison Blues (At Folsom Prison),"""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
SooooEEEE!!
I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
283,Johnny Cash,Country Boy,"Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day
While you're wanting to play
In the sun and the sand
With a face that's tan
But at the end of the day
When your work is done
You ain't got nothing but fun

Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills

You get a wiggly worm
And then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook
And you drop him in a brook
And if everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight

Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you was me
Country boy, got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew
You got to cut the weeds
You got to plant the seeds
There's many a row
You know you gotta hoe
But when it's quittin' time
And your work is through
There's a lot of life in you

Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run
When you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two
And your dog and you
When you get your rabbit
You'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

These are my people in brotherhood we're heirs of a creed to live by
A creed that proclaims that by loved ones blood stains
This is my land and these are my people
These are my people they were born on and lived by the land
These are my people and their cities were raised by hard working hands
And their faces to tell that they're holding on well
To this their land yes these are my people
These are my people these are the ones who will reach for the stars
These are my people that a light of the earth you can tell they are ours
A new step to take and a new day will break

Doin' life or ninety-nine

But jailer, oh, jailer

286,Johnny Cash,Like the 309,"It should be a while before I see Dr. Death
So it would sure be nice if I could get my breath
Well I'm not the crying nor the whining kind
Until I hear the whistle of the 309

Of the 309, of the 309
Put me in my box on the 309

Take me to the depot, put me to bed
Blow an electric fan on my gnarly old head
Everybody take a look, see I'm doing fine
Then load my box on the 309


Hey sweet baby, kiss me hard
Draw my bath water, sweep my yard
Give a drink of my wine to my Jersey cow
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for my journey now
On the 309, on the 309
I hear the sound of a railroad train
The whistle blows and I'm gone again
It will take me higher than a Georgia pine
Stand back children, it's a 309

A chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
Ain't felt this good since jubilee morn
Talk about luck, well I got mine
Asthma coming down like a 309
Write me a letter, sing me a song
Tell me all about it, what I did wrong
Meanwhile I will be doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

287,Johnny Cash,Cocaine Carolina,"Morning found me lying on a floor in New Orleans
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina
Met her on an ocean liner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two
God knows how much I adored her, I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky
Lexington was famous for it's bluegrass and its hills
Carolina, we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up?
Maybe I should go to California

I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at
Got the number ""Thirteen"" tattooed on my neck
When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red

I was born in the soul of misery
Never had me a name
They just gave me the number when I was young

Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well
The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell

And if the blues don't leave, I rock on away from here
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is healing slow
I've never had such trouble in my whole life before
I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line

What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
About a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains around my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see
If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reached the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take!
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real;
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
About a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone

He got fighting mad this rebel lad
He packed no star as he wandered far
Where the only law was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma

He searched the land this restless lad
He was panther quick and leather tough
If he figured that he'd been pushed enough
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
(Away, away, away rolled the rebel)

Fighting mad this rebel lad
With a dream he'd hold until his dying breath
He'd search his soul and gamble with death
