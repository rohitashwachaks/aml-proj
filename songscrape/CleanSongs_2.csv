0,Jim Morrison,The Ghost Song,"Awake.
Shake dreams from your hair
my pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
the day's divinity
First thing you see.
A vast radiant beach and cooled jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us.
Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
the time has come again
choose now, they croon
beneath the moon
beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
everything is broken up and dances.
Indians scattered,
On dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child’s
Fragile eggshell mind
We have assembled inside,
This ancient and insane theater
To propagate our lust for life,
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets.
The barns have stormed
The windows kept,
And only one of all the rest
To dance and save us
From the divine mockery of words,
Music inflames temperament.
Ooh great creator of being
Grant us one more hour,
To perform our art
And perfect our lives.
We need great golden copulations,
When the true kings murderers
Are allowed to roam free,
A thousand magicians arise in the land
Where are the feast we are promised?
One more thing
Thank you oh lord
For the white blind light
Thank you oh lord
For the white blind light
A city rises from the sea
I had a splitting headache
"
1,Jim Morrison,A Feast Of Friends,"Wow, I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain south
Cruel bindings
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors
I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV tower
I want roses in my garden bower, dig?
Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal for the plant that's plowed
They are waiting to take us into the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour?
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you've brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven's claws
No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until its other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a Feast of Friends
"
2,Jim Morrison,An American Prayer,"Do you know the warm progress under the stars?
Do you know we exist?
Have you forgotten the keys to the kingdom?
Have you been born yet, and are you alive?
Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
Have you forgotten the lessons of the ancient war?
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being lead to slaughter by placid admirals
And that fat slow generals are getting obscene on young blood?
Do you know we are ruled by T.V.?
The moon is a dry blood beast
Guerrilla bands are rolling numbers
In the next block of green vine
Amassing for warfare on innocent herdsman who are just dying
O' great creator of being, grant us one more hour to perform our art and perfect our lives
The moths and atheists are doubly divine and dying
We live, we die, and death not ends it
Journey we more into the Nightmare
Cling to life our passioned flower
Cling to Cunts & Cocks of despair
We got our final vision by clap
Columbus's groin got filled with green death
I touched her thigh and death smiled
We have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept
And only one of all the rest to dance and save us with the divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament
When the true King's murderers are allowed to roam free
A 1000 Magicians arise in the land
Where are the feasts we are promised?
"
3,Jim Morrison,Stoned Immaculate,"I'll tell you this...
No eternal reward will forgive us now
For wasting the dawn

Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused
One summer night, going to the pier
I ran into two young girls
The blonde one was called Freedom
The dark one, Enterprise
We talked and they told me this story
Now listen to this...
I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat
Soft driven, slow and mad
Like some new language
Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night
Out here in the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we IS stoned
"
4,Jim Morrison,Lament,"Lament for my cock
Sore and crucified
I seek to know you
Acquiring soulful wisdom
You can open walls of mystery
Strip show
How to acquire death in the morning show
TV death which the child absorbs
Deathwell mystery which makes me write
Slow train, the death of my cock gives life
Forgive the poor old people who gave us entry
Taught us God in the child's prayer in the night
Guitar player
Ancient wise satyr
Sing your ode to my cock
Caress its lament
Stiffen and guide us, we frozen
Lost cells
The knowledge of cancer
To speak to the heart
And give the great gift
Words, power, trance
This stable friend and the beast of his zoo
Wild haired chicks
Women flowering in their summit
Monsters of skin
Each color connects
to create the boat
which rocks the race
Could any hell be more horrible
Than now and real?
I pressed her thigh and death smiled
Death, old friend
Death and my cock are the world
I can forgive my injuries in the name of
Wisdom, luxury, romance
Sentence upon sentence
Words are healing lament
For the death of my cock's spirit
Has no meaning in the soft fire
Words got me the wound and will get me well
If you believe it
All join now and lament for the death of my cock
A tongue of knowledge in the feathered night
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer
"
5,Jim Morrison,Newborn Awakening,"Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile egg-shell mind
Blood in the streets
In the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs
And the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love
In the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of
Phantastic L.A
Blood screams her brain
As they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born
In the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of
Mysterious union
Blood on the rise
It's following me
Indian, Indian
What did you die for?
Indian says nothing at all
Gently they stir
Gently rise
The dead are new-born awakening
With ravaged limbs
And wet souls
Gently they sigh
In rapt funeral amazement
Who called these dead to dance?
Was it the young woman
Learning to play the ""Ghost Song""
In her baby grand
Was it the wilderness children?
Was it the Ghost-God himself
Stuttering, cheering
Chatting blindly?
I called you up to
Annoint the earth
I called you to announce
Sadness falling like
Burned skin
I called you to wish you well
To glory in self like a new monster
And now I call on you to prayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
6,Jim Morrison,The Movie,"The movie will begin in five moments
The mindless voice announced
All those unseated will await the next show
We filed slowly, languidly into the hall
The auditorium was vast and silent
As we seated and were darkened
The voice continued:
The program for this evening is not new
You've seen this entertainment through and through
You've seen your birth, your life and death
You might recall all of the rest
Did you have a good world when you died?
Enough to base a movie on?
I'm getting out of here
Where are you going?
To the other side of morning
Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas
Her cunt gripped him like a warm friendly hand
It's all right, all your friends are here
When can I meet them?
After you've eaten
I'm not hungry
Uh, we meant beaten
Silver stream, silvery scream
Oooh, impossible concentrationEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

My kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames

9,Jim Morrison,Freedom Exists,"Did you know freedom exists
In a school book?
Did you know madmen
Are running our prison
Within a jail, within a gaol
Within a white free protestant
Maelstrom
We're perched headlong
On the edge of boredom
We're reaching for death
On the end of a candle
We're trying for something
That's already found usEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
10,Jim Morrison,Angels and Sailors,"Angels and sailors
Rich girls, backyard fences, tents
Dreams watching each other narrowly
Soft luxuriant cars
Girls in garages, stripped
Out to get liquor and clothes
Half gallons of wine and six packs of beer
Jumped, humped, born to suffer
Made to undress in the wilderness
I will never treat you mean
Never start no kind of scene
I'll tell you
Every place and person that I've been
Always a playground instructor
Never a killer
Always a bridesmaid
On the verge of fame or over
He manuevered two girls
Into his hotel room
One a friend
The other, the young one
A newer stranger
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican
Poor boys thighs and buttocks
Scarred by a father's belt
She's trying to rise
Story of her boyfriend
Of teenage stoned death games
Handsome lad, dead in a car
Confusion
No connections
Come here
I love you
Peace on earth
Will you die for me?
Eat me
This way
The end
I'll always be true
Never go out, sneaking out on you, babe
If you'll only show me Far Arden again
I'm surprised you could get it up
He whips her lightly, sardonically with belt
""Haven't I been through enough?"" she asks
Now dressed and leaving
The Spanish girl begins to bleed;
She says her period
It's Catholic heaven
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck
My chest is hard and brown
Lying on stained, wretched sheets
With a bleeding virgin
We could plan a murder
Or start a religionEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
11,Jim Morrison,Hour For Magic,"Resident mockery
Give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight and velvet hour
We of arabic pleasure's breed
We of sundome and the night
Give us a creed
To believe
A night of Lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
Hundred hues
A rich Mandala
For me and you
And for your silky
Pillowed house
A head, wisdom
And a bed
Troubled decree
Resilent mockery
Has claimed thee
We used to believe
In the good old days
We still receive
In little ways
The Things of Kindness
And unsporting brow
Forget and allowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
12,Jim Morrison,Black Polished Chrome,"The music was new, black polished chrome
And came over the summer like liquid night
The DJ's took pills to stay awake
And play for seven days
They went to the studio
And someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman
He came to our homeroom party
And played records and when he left
In the hot noon sun
And walked to his car
We saw the Chooks had written
F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a white rag
And smiling cooly drove away
He's rich
Got a big carEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
13,Jim Morrison,Dawn’s Highway,"Me and my mother and father -
And a grandmother and a grandfather -
Were driving through the desert
At dawn, and a truck load of Indian workers
Had either hit another car, or just -
I don't know what happened -
But there were Indians scattered
All over the highway, bleeding to death
So the car pulls up and stops
That was the first time I tasted fear
I must've been about four -
Like a child is like a flower
His head is just floating in the breeze, man
The reaction I get now thinking about it
Looking back - is that the souls
Or the ghosts, of those dead Indians
Maybe one or two of them
Were just running around freaking out
And just leaped into my soul
And they're still in thereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
14,Jim Morrison,Awake,"Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
15,Jim Morrison,Latino Chrome,"My gang will get you
Scenes of rape in the arroyo
Seductions in cars, abandoned buildings
Fights at the food stand
The dust
The shoes
Open shirts and raised collars
Bright sculptured hair
Hey man, you want girls, pills, grass?
Come on, I show you good time
This place has everything
Come on, I show youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
16,Jim Morrison,The Hitchhiker,"Thoughts in time and out of season
The Hitchhiker
Stood by the side of the road
And leveled his thumb
In the calm calculus of reason
Hi. How you doin'? I just got back into town L.A
I was out on the desert for awhile
Riders on the storm
Yeah. In the middle of it
Riders on the storm
Right...
Into this house we're born
Hey, listen, man, I really got a problem
Into this world we're thrown
When I was out on the desert, ya know
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
I don't know how to tell you
Riders on the storm
But, ah, I killed somebody
There's a killer on the road
No...
His brain is squirming like a toad
It's no big deal, ya know
I don't think anybody will find out about it, but...
Take a long holiday
Just, ah...
Let your children play
This guy gave me a ride, and ah...
If you give this man a ride
Started giving me a lot of trouble
Sweet family will die
And I just couldn't take it, ya know
Killer on the road
And I wasted him
YeahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
17,Jim Morrison,The World On Fire,"The world on fire
Taxi from Africa
The Grand Hotel
He was drunk -
A big party last night.
Back, going back
In all directions.
Sleeping these insane hours.
I'll never wake up in a good mood again.
I'm sick of these stinky boots.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
18,Jim Morrison,"Curses, Invocations","Curses, invocations
Weird bate-headed mongrels
I keep expecting one of you to rise
Large buxom obese queens
Garden hogs and cunt veterans
Quaint cabbage saints
Shit hoarders and individualists
Drag strip officials
Tight lipped losers and
Lustful fuck salesmen
My militant dandies
All strange order of monsters
Hot on the trail of the woodvine
We welcome you to our procession
Here come the comedians
Look at them smile
Watch them dance an Indian mile
Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone
Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks
Plant them they will grow
Watch them waver so
I'll always be a word man
Better than a bird manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
19,Jim Morrison,The American Night,"for leather accrues
The miracle of the streets
The scents & smogs &
pollens of existence
Shiny blackness
so totally naked she was
Totally un-hung-up
We looked around
lights now on
Top see our fellow travellers
~~~
I am troubled
Immeasurably
By your eyes
I am struck
By the feather
of your soft
Reply
The sound of glass
Speaks quick
Disdain
And conceals
What your eyes fight
To explain
~~~
She looked so sad in sleep
Like a friendly hand
just out of reach
A candle stranded on
a beach
While the sun sinks low
an H-bomb in reverse
~~~
Everything human
is leaving
her face
Soon she will disappear
into the calm
vegetable
morass
Stay!
My Wild Love!
~~~
I get my best ideas when the
telephone rings & rings. It’s no fun
To feel like a fool-when your
baby’s gone. A new ax to my head:
Possession. I create my own sword
of Damascus. I’ve done nothing w/time.
A little tot prancing the boards playing
w/Revolution. When out there the
World awaits & abounds w/heavy gangs
of murderers & real madmen. Hanging
from windows as if to say: I’m bold-
do you love me? Just for tonight.
A One Night Stand. A dog howls & whines
at the glass sliding door (why can’t I
be in there?) A cat yowls. A car engine
revs & races against the grain- dry
rasping carbon protest. I put the book
down- & begin my own book.
Love for the fat girl.
When will SHE get here?
~~~
In the gloom
In the shady living room
where we lived & died
& laughed & cried
& the pride of our relationship
took hold that summer
What a trip
To hold your hand
& tell the cops
you’re not 16
no runaway
The wino left a little in
the old blue desert
bottle
Cattle skulls
the cliche of rats
who skim the trees
in search of fat
Hip children invade the grounds
& sleep in the wet grass
’til the dogs rush out
I’m going South!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
20,Jim Morrison,To Come Of Age,"A military station in the desert.
Can we resolve the past -
Lurking jaws joints of time -
The base - to come of age in a dry place -
Holes and caves.
My friend drove an hour
Each day from the mountains.
The bus gives you a hard-on
With books in your lap.
Someone shot the bird
In the afternoon dance show.
They gave out free records
To the best couple.
Spades dance best, from the hip.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
21,Jim Morrison,Babylon Fading,"Then we hear a whistle

22,Jim Morrison,Abortion Stories,"There’s blood in the streets, it’s up to my ankles
(She came)
There’s blood on the streets, it’s up to my knee
(She came)
Blood on the streets, in the town of Chicago
(She came)
Blood on the rise, it’s following me
Think about the break of day
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
(She came)
Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness
(She came)
Blood in the streets it’s up to my thigh
(She came)
Yeah, the river runs red down the legs of the city
(She came)
The women are crying rivers of weepin’
She came into town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Indians scattered on dawn’s highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child’s fragile eggshell mind
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.
Blood screams the pain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
There’s blood in the streets, it’s up to my ankles
Blood in the streets, it’s up to my knee
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise, it’s following meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
23,Jim Morrison,Perceptual Notions,"Jim Morrison - Singer
The Doors
LA, San Francisco all open down the coast
West coast
The west is the best
The doors unconcious
The gap is getting wider, day by day
The doors the band you love to hate
Strange days
Death
Rebellion, chaos, disorder and activities that appears to have no meaning
A central theme or motive, a thread running through the songs, we dont have
But we deffinetily do have generate an atmosphere or mood which might be characterized as an awareness of the strange thats somethings wrong, somethings not quite right

24,Jim Morrison,Roadhouse Rap,"Hey gentlemens, gentlemens
Now the subject of this song is, uh
Something all of you have seen
One time or another, it's an old roadhouse
Ahh we're down in the south, or in the midwest
Or maybe on the way to Bakersfield
And we're, we're drivin' in a '57 chevy
To an old roadhouse, can you dig it?
You know, it's about uhh 1:30
And we're not driving too fast
But we're not driving too slow either
We've got a six pack of beer in the car
A few joints, and we're just ahh listening
To the radio and driving to the old
Roadhouse, through nature, dig it?
Well, I want to tell you people about
Something I know . .

I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy

28,Billie Eilish,​everything i wanted,"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

29,Billie Eilish,Happier Than Ever,"When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)

30,Billie Eilish,​idontwannabeyouanymore,"Don't be that way

Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?

32,Billie Eilish,​i love you,"It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh

Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say ""I love you""
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry

Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say ""I love you""
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh

And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)

You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 ""heys"" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice

The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace

Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)
You say, ""Come over, baby
I think you're pretty""
I'm okay, I'm not your baby

Better off without them

Still just drinking canned Coke

On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Morning as they come down (Come down)

Still just drinking canned Coke

On designated drives home

Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break

What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn

52,Billie Eilish,8,"Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm
You said, ""Don't treat me badly""
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me

53,Billie Eilish,NDA,"Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh

You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (I think I hate it here)
Maybе I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars

You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me

55,Billie Eilish,​​come out and play,"Hmm-mm

Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm

You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside

Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

""Stay"" and ""blah blah blah""
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
""It's not you, it's me"" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

You'll hear ""stay"" and ""blah blah blah""
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday

57,Billie Eilish,6.18.18*,"Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know

I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind

To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th hell to pay
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind

59,Billie Eilish,Male Fantasy,"Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy

'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

(Want me to sing in here?)
(Okay)

I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around

Be alright, convince myself I hate you

'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if She saw us

She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away

I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
I wanna make you yell (Yell)
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
Don't wanna treat you well (Well)

Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away

61,Billie Eilish,Billie Bossa Nova,"Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Na-na-na

Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)

I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide

You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression (You sure do)
Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm

I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm ('Bout the way you look tonight)
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)

You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though (Torture though)
I know, I know
You better lock your door (Oh)
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)

62,Billie Eilish,The End of the World,"Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone

If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth, mmm
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me?
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me

If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agreed
"
63,Billie Eilish,Lost Cause,"Something's in the—

Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (You, you)
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew

I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong (Wrong)

You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job (Job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
I used to think you were shy (Shy)
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine (Mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
(So) So easy (So, so)
Hee, mm-mm-mm, mm

Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong (Wrong)

You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Yeah)
But you got no job (No job)
You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Think you're such a lost cause)
But you got no job

64,Billie Eilish,Halley’s Comet,"I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few

Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you

I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you

I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love
"
65,Billie Eilish,Getting Older,"I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm

Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna

Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

67,Billie Eilish,WHEN I WAS OLDER,"When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm

I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be

I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah

When I was older

Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed

Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean

I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyеs)
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't dеserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend, too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news

69,Billie Eilish,Not My Responsibility,"Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?

We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone

""Everybody dies,"" that's what they say

I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone

I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?

You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone

74,Billie Eilish,​ocean eyes (Astronomyy Remix),"I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

You really know how to make me cry

I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

75,Billie Eilish,​sHE’s brOKen,"Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade

He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'

And everybody wants to think they won't
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

Infected, standing there all alone

Seven days

I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all, no more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away

'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

I know you don't care, but can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
And now it's missing

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

You said, ""Don't treat me badly""
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry, why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love is never for me?

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you

I never even got a kiss without a countdown

Only text back when you're hungry

Boy, you never listen

I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
Time to come to terms, put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
I'm telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen

I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

So take this as my last reply and play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you
Ooh-ooh, to erase you
Ooh-ooh, to erase you
Ooh-ooh, to erase you

81,Billie Eilish,Happier Than Ever (Edit),"You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I’m wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin’ friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin’ sad
So don’t waste the time I don't have
And don’t try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you ’cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?

Or could I easily fill his shoes?

Now we’re just outside of town
And you’re making your way down

And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway

You and your fit friends anyway

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake

106,Billie Eilish,Telegraph Ave,"I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight (Mad tight, mad tight)
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy

Mmm

Lay on me the weight of the world
Smiling like you're given a gift
Don't you wanna dance with your little girl?
In the shadows, I can see those things you hid
From me

You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned
Mmm
Mmm

Twist my words and then wring 'em out
Drag me down into your jealousy
Rising to inside your open mouth
Taking out your whole life on me
On me
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned

Don't tell me to come home, you must be stoned
Won't be wrapped up in your wings that spread with disaster
No, I'm not all those things you might be after
Maybe you're just too stoned to see you're the reason I don't come home
Too faded to see my heart's growin' blacker

You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stonedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
111,Billie Eilish,Secret,"You were from the North, I was from the South
We were from opposite places, different towns
But I knew it was good and you knew it was too
So we moved together like a ball and chain
Minds becoming two halves of the same
It was real, and the shadows grew
Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
I would've shouted loud and broken through
I would've given it all to belong to you
But there were different plans, different rules
You said ""where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show you the way to the rest of my sins""
Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should know
Yeah I should know
Yeah you, you've got a secret don't ya babe?
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?

If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn

Never let you burn
Let you burn, let you burn
Never gonna let you burn

Your number might be blocked

Look - now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs
You hear ""stay"" and ""bla bla bla""

If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

Could roses...

Erase your touch

When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone

Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you

You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
