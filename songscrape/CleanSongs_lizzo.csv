0,Lizzo,Truth Hurts,"Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)
We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay
I'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)
We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay (Woo)

8,Lizzo,Soulmate,"True story
No glory, let's go

Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like ""Damn, she the one""

One, one, one, one, one, one (The one)
Like ""Damn, she the one""
One, one, one (The one)
Bad bitch in the mirror like ""Yeah, I'm in love""
Love, love, love, love, love, love (In love)
Like ""Yeah, I'm in love""
Love, love, love (In love)
Look up in the mirror like ""Damn, she the one""
And she never tell me to exercise
We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

True love ain't something you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself
Another round from the bottle on the higher shelf

'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
(Always gonna hold me down)
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
(No, I'm never lonely, no)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

Ooh, what's deeper than, what's deeper than the darkest best
Kept secret? Beneath the surface, we could
Let it bring us together, or it could tear us apart, oh
I'm filled with it, I gotta love with no conditions
Though it's hard to re-envision time and time again
Even when, even when it didn't matter anymore
The most beautiful thing that you ever seen
Is even bigger than what we think it means
Reflections in my bloodstreams, it's even bigger than

I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin

Real world, big girl meets world
A crazy position, now your dreams is your mission, huh?
Staring in the mirror, realizing, wish it worked
Now all I wish is for a chance to give my kids a Ford
I got a family tree that's worth praising the Lord
Mama looking like the second, whoo! Look at God
Sister like a soldier, hold it down
Southwest gon' hold it down, uh
I love you, don't forget it, you beautiful Black masterpiece!
Boy, they don't make brothers like you
Uh, make it happen with that Black girl magic
The hat trick off of what we must do

Pardon me, just left a message to the city
Words stuck between my teeth, so gritty
Pay him for each minute I'm seething
A Black girl mixed with a little bit of Sacagawea
I pocket subpoenas, I swallow my pride and my ego
I wear my flaws on my sleeve and my skin like a peacoat
I see someone like me ashamed to be
And honestly, I'm really really
I'm fed up wit' it, try to send it up like a FedEx
I'm wondering what they sayin' next
Can't pretend to not hear it

My hands are cold
My lips are tired, tryin' to blow (blow!)
To give them warmth
It's not enough, one heart alone
Cannot suffice
It simply can't, I've done the math
But in due time
There is no chance, for love

I try to try (see the love through)
I try, to try

Your skin is warm
It keeps me up though I am tired
I’m tryin' to know
What else? Why else has this happened?
One man alone
Cannot suffice, I’ve done the research
Ignore the role
Inside my bed, your lion features (no!)
You can't lay on my shoulder
There are spikes and scales
And your cheek would just depress me
(In) a heavy haze, we love it
Love the taste of it, (you clench your jaw)
We love it, (you love it!)
Humanize me, baby
Humanize me, baby
I try!

I try to try, I, I (see the love through)

26,Lizzo,Ride,"LA carolin' with Carolyn
Caroline but I had to make it rhyme, I'm
Addicted to that weather like heroin
That is why I cannot give it any time, just say no!
It's too good to me, you are too good to me
O.D. on compliments, I need some oxygen
So I dip to the PNW, some of ya don't need where that is - good!
Need a little solitude with my crew
'Membering what's real is what makes you you, oh!
It's too good to me, know it's no good for me
I can't be out here homie, what it used to be
Sitting in bed like ""man!"", wishing
Itching for days with no end
Sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
Getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like Satan
You can't have it? Take it, you can't man up? K then
Breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!

And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
Flying into Paris with Sophia Eris
Had a heart-to-heart over fresh croissant
Wondering why these dudes be tripping
She like ""Girl I'm past giving a damn!""
YOLO, guess that's why he want a photo
Dressed in Polo, arm around me after the show
But never there when I need hoes
Open mind but my heart closed, ah!
Where ya been? Back again, young man?
I remember you from way way when
You never gave it or reciprocated
But when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
""She left me"" is always the excuse
I swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo
Meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
Google me and jack off in a tissue

Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
I will never be the person that you want me to
Feeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do
But I'm here now, like how this happen?
Head in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n
I'm chilling, I swear I been chilling
Taking a break, feeling hella breakable
I was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
Bet I made some, granted
But my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
Wrote this song halfway to Chicago
Wondering if I should call you
What, to make you feel special?
Would it give me reasons to forget you?
(Hey, you reached Lizzo. Leave me a message..)
I'm out of state, out of time
You more like out of sight, out of mind

Yeah! You know what though?

28,Lizzo,Ain’t I,"Uh, uh, uh, I'm in the, I'm in the, I'm in the
I'm in the business of making music, that music business
The fitness, no one can witness cause I
I make that crack music (nigga!), uh
That real Black music (nigga!)
The only singles that I'm dropping are the ones
Flapping at the band of your white briefs
White boys please! Can barely believe
I walk by as they hold they skeets by the seams of they jeans
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, and run it to the hills y'all
Straight into my pocket, tired of the deals dog
Start my own label, keep the leaking sealed off
If you got a big mouth, then you might get peeled off
I'm the only fat-lipped bass, my flipper--vroom!--peel off
Eating flounder, Sebastian's like some bath salts
Munching on his bones, looking at him like ""It's yo' fault!""
""Look at what you made me do! Yo, pass the hot sauce""

Looking at the back of Sophia Eris's head
Eating a sammich (but we don't got bread!)
Got a spider ass bite on my head, hangry
Feeling soupy, I brought my fuck in, yo I'm duckin'
Donald, Daffy, Howards, them cowards
Could never throw shots at a super with power
What was Russia without the czars?
What was Henry Ford without the cars?
My grandparents worked at Ford factory
So Henry is nothing without my family tree
And his slave-owning family needed Black blood still
So I think we need a spot up on Henry's will
That would never be the case, in case you ain't keeping up
I'm dishing out cases of that heavy bass
And them bassheads straight from the oppressor's loins
Are giving us our ""Free us!"" in hella coin
So bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy

It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go

It don't matter how deep yo' soul is

It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go
They still get they fill, fingers scrape the bottom
It don't matter how deep yo' soul is

I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

Kissing on my mirror
Staring in my eyes
Appreciating every curve and crevice
Smack my thighs
Smack it twice, watch it jiggle
You a bad batch cookie, cream filling in the middle
I'm a very picky girl
And yes you can call me mama
I got an A in self-esteem
So save the drama for Obama
Presidential in my stature
Statuesque and big as hell
If you in love with what you do, then leave them thirsties by the well
If they talking bout you, let 'em
You they entertainment
Reading you yo rights, just make it rain what they arrangin'
It's raining, it's pouring
Men and they're boring
Hallelujah thanking Jesus he made men so they could please us
All these years been searching for something that would complete me
Who knew that it would be me
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

Okay, this verse is about my best friend, bad as she can be
The only one that's on her level happens to be me
She'll give you a sprinkle, to them flounders bottom feeding
But ween 'em
As quick as she get that peen in
Ditch like a queen can
Skzzrt, after dinner I like that dessert
But he thirsty like he in the desert
What's worse, give it to him or get my own
Think I'm bout to hit him with that scissor
Cut, print, this scene is done
Nice to know, you all so nice to know
Level son, you on level one
I'm like ding, ding, ding, elevation
All my beautiful, big black beauty girls
Brown paper bag,  coke can, chill pants
Light skin, curly hair
Afro, in the air
Love yourself like nobody else can

Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why

Grasp for the raps for the stack when they can. Do
Slack, and I have to attack and offend you
Smashing these tracks...and that's what I'm into

Of my God damn time so I leave it up to me
You been sendin' all these broken signals

You tell me that I am too ambitious
But I break the moulds and you just watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll

Can't buy liquor on a Sunday, what is you sayin'?
But beyond that man, a nigga can't explain
But beyond you, I could finally see the sand
Excuse me while I give myself a freakin' tan
Kill 'em all like I'm the freakin' Son of Sam
It's like I'm a Muslim and you a piece of ham, yuck
I would never touch ya
Rather, you will never touch me, good luck though

Runnin' and runnin' until I can't go

Part and polly up in lane, partly and polly out makin' particles
Sparkle, that glitter ain't gold, that glitter ain't gold at all
She lyin', you lyin', go flyin', the strike of the iron, that's hot
Step back from pitter pat, get that from the tit for tat

Sugar plums and candy canes, they did nothing for me
You could find me home alone and ordering Chinese
But now I save that old fruit cake 'cause there's enough for two
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with
You, you, oh, you, you, you, you, you, you

The nutcracker was boring and the carolers off-key
I never saw a miracle on 50-something Street
But now I'm singing, bells are ringing, everything is new
I'm fa-la-la-la-la-ling into love with you, ooh ooh oh, you
All these years, I've been let down until you came around
It never felt like Christmas
January, February, April, March and May
Come and go when I'm alone, December felt the same
But when I see that red and green, now I don't feel so blue
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

49,Lizzo,Wat U Mean,"A-what you mean? Been up in this thing so long, I'm like a sleeve
Covering, I'm outchea, please don't be deceived
Roll me up? Nigga please! Don't be presumptuous
I packed you up for lunch and I ate you, you were scrumptious
Literal or not, I'm rambunctious, you yellow belly munchkins
Ain't that something? With your oompady-doo like
""Ding dong, the witch ain't dead, you better look out 'fore she chop yo' head!""
Breaking bread with the queens at the dinner table
Lapdogs eat scraps if you're able
Maybe throw you a bone if I feel like it
Maybe give you some steak if the mood right
Right now, homie, bow down
Looking at my head like my head need a crown
Crown on the rocks, nigga, weed in the box, nigga
Give me if you got figures, what I want's a lot bigger!

What you mean
What you mean
What you mean
To me, to me, to me, to me

Lizzo be eating though, Lizzo be hungry
Lizzo Big GRRRL Small World till it ain't funny
Say my name three times like I'm in destiny
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Four Loko
Chillin' with my niggas in the back like mane
Came a long way, umbrellas for the rain
If you came this far, you better play the game
Because success and fame be two different things
I remember being sad about boys and stuff
But that was way back in middle school
Now I'm making crowds make noise and stuff
And all my people back home like, ""who knew?""
Normally I don't like to toot my own horn
Cause I don't got a car yet and, well, that sucks
Being a rapper these days ain't what it seems
Man, really you ain't making all the big bucks, but I'm killin' it
I'm just saying that I'm feeling the wheeling one would experience
While wheeling and gripping the wheel and gettin' it
And my limericks be the same thing that get me on the cover, trick!
What you mean

51,Lizzo,Hot Dish,"I got a lot on my chest, so here's my breast reduction
I hear the sounds of gums bumping, they ain't saying nothing
I'm sick and tired of being typecast like Lindsay Lohan
When I'm gonna probably outlast most of these niggas flowing
A cover girl with the mouth of a tommy gun
Blow trees and I will blow you away when I'm on the stage
I guess that's why I got them shivering they're very afraid
I guess that's why my checks thin cause dem hate
They steady instigatin' on what they hate on
I'm the rainbow bridge like a pack of 50 crayons
Cause I ain't got no beef with no body
But those bodies need to realize that this is no hobby
I ain't your hook girl, boo, I'm your feature
And I don't need your attention because of my features
I swear to God I feel like a piece of meat every time I'm walking home or even a block from lake street
Man, give me room the only rapper with a womb that will spit that 16 bars to send you rappers to the tomb
Me and my crew we ain't playin' around
Cause ever since we landed we just been the talk of the town
While I talk I remember those who paid the price
I lost my pops man I wish he was alive
I can't let go of the past, he never heard me rap
So I carry his spirit on my back in Minneap
Lizzo in this thing so great, to complement my shape
Nicknamed hot dish complements of the state
I see you hungry niggas
Here you go, some steak
I guess you are what you eat
I guess you're Lizzo taint
Apologies to my mother she thinks that I'm a saint
Apologies to the rappers I dusted out the gate
Yo, I see you munching on my plate
Rip to any beat I meet, see ya
All these hoes wanna suck my (gasp)
But I don't got a (gasp) so I tell them ""deal with it""
All these niggas wanna ride my (gasp) but I don't got a (gasp) So I tell them ""deal with it""
I peter piper picked a plain pepper and gave it spice
Paprika, eureka, I see ya pow! pow!
My mouth is a gun and the bullets that kaow! kaow!
Are ammo of the knowledge that you don't know
But know now
Sick and tired of these hypocrites
I generations to back me up
Mama Kirkwood and Daddy Jefferson had to deal with it so I'm done
They raped and murdered my ancestors
Hung my great uncle from a tree
So when I look at that maple branch I look in the mirror and say ""could be me""
All of these niggas don't know where I'm from
All of these hoes they just wanna have fun
Acting like junkies
Looking like bums
Lower than scum
What's lower scum
What's lower than dumb?
The ignorance displayed by his insolence
He sprayed all the businesses
And laid someone's significant other and mother and brother in the streets
Who said that was OK?
Who said that was cool?
I said it was cool
So what's all the blues, bitch
Take a dip the city's swimming in blood poolsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
52,Lizzo,Luv It,"Mane, hold up, tell me how you really feel
Grippin' on the wood grain in the Coupe de Ville
Drippin' stains, swervin' lanes, actin' bad, grabbin' cash
In the Frenchies, bad, representin' south of the H-Town
Bout to ball at the mall, call it Galleria
Hatin' niggas from a distance, call it like I see it
""Yes, ma'am"" and ""No, ma'am"", they always glad to meet ya
Stuntin' up in Pappadeaux's, they always glad to treat ya
Sexy papi though, starts down with that shiny grill
Lookin' out of his tinted window, I know it's something like (What's the deal?)
So throwed, ridin' slow, my clique jazzy, yo' clique hoes, ew! Wouldn't touch 'em with a 50-foot pole, even Pepé Le Pew said no
I'm a playa, I don't let nobody take my shine
I get mine, you could feel me like my  around
We gettin' down all the way till the sun come up
Sippin' all the purple all out the white cup
 (x2)
How ya like me now cause I'm real?
How ya like me? How ya like me now cause I'm real?
How ya like me? How ya like me now cause I'm real?
Touch down, piece and chain, fool, shiny grill

Huh, you know I love it, mane
Uh, you know I love it, mane
Yeah, love it, mane
These fickle, fickle niggas holdin' out for a pretty penny
You swallowin' the truth and now you wizzin' like it's Henny
I'm ""run, Forest, run""-ing and my instincts be Jenny
Jenny Craigin' on them boys, I cut the fat and keep the skinny
Here's a skinny on them motherfuckers that get caught up
Yeah, you tryna be the man and ya pushin' ya luck
And you frontin' like we homies then you call me like I owe thee
What about the shit you owe me like the time I spent with yo' ass for free?
You really think I'd waste my time with you?
Building a business relationship if the shit gon' sink?
Nigga, that's how you really feel? Nigga, that's how you think?
Think again next time ya come steppin' to me
Cause I wasn't put on this earth to sing back up for you
Especially if you gon' be selfish and not come through
And I told yo' ho ass partner ""Go fuck off"" too
So we know why I don't fuck around with you
And I hope it burns in yo' stomach cause Lizzo on the rise
And I won't respond to yo' e-mails like ""Duh"", surprise
And I don't hold grudges but, boy, ya cut off
And, I mean, you got a little bit of talent but that's not enough
Awwww maannn

53,Lizzo,Be Still,"I wake up every morning feeling like slapping a nigga
Squeeze trigger, stay scheming then I realize I'm still dreaming
Oops, psych! Believing in believers ability to still scream for a nigga till you get nosebleeds
I be so scuffed up from kicking them rocks
And if you're so tough come run up and get clocked
Tick tock tock tock
If you got them slippery socks
Yo I'mma give it all that I got
To make a nigga slide in the vault
Then bake a nigga dash in some salt
I bring a nigga home and pole vault
Then blame a nigga like it's your fault
Your bad!
(It's your fault!)
I never understood and I will never understand
The tolerance for ho-ishness that some of you people have
""ME?"" You, yeah you
I'm talking to the middle man
Like how you're content with giving someone else the upper hand
Walking around your cubicle, your tie with your coffee mug
Siphoning the hard earned work from the thugs and hustlers, cuz
Takin a chill pill before I whip my sword out like Uma in Kill Bill
Makin niggas gasp like Emmett Till
And I'mma keep on giving you the gospel like God's will, Peace! Be Still
This is God's will peace be still
This is God's will peace be still
This is God's will peace be still
Can I fall in love before the world ends?
Can my record get a few major spins? I'm saying
I don't wanna think about tomorrow because I'm still hustling
Until then, I guess it's just me, you, theses food stamps and cravings
No raisins in the sun, just Funyuns and a Sunkist, we up in the club making it mist
Like a missed alcohol (though I see it every night)
And that Tylenol I take everyday period like Midol
Bye y'all, I'm moving on to other things by y'all
But not quite bilateral, more like three floors up and down the hall
Let the bygones be bygones, and try to keep the peace like Obama and Biden
All my friends are talented, all my friends got mad skills
All my girlfriends wear heels, all my niggas drug deal
We're tight (psych!)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
54,Lizzo,Go,"Wake up in the morning and stop
Feeling like the world’s going to drop
If I don’t do nothing, I’m going to pop
Now I’m hotter than a boiling pot
If you super tight, people flip
If you fall off, you’re a flop
Never thought nothing, would be better than something
That’s why I stay watering my crops

I’m not thirsty baby, I’m just lonely
And I’m not distant baby, I’m just busy
Will you miss me baby, when I’m touring
Or will you find someone that’s less important
But worth exploring, I’m torn in pieces
So much to do, hold on got to write in these features
I’m listening, but not really
You know us artist types
When we got to go, you got to let us

Go (gotta let us)- repeat

It’s cold outside
And I was thinking
And I was thinking
How warm it is
In the cloud (posturepedic)
But all that is, is vapor, condensation, conversation
Not really, but Jack Daniel's is the life of the party
Get it started, let him do the talking
Let that man speak
This girl is going to break your heart
Run far away this is your head start
Everything is not what it seems
The girl of your dreams is a nightmare
You don’t care
Man, that Jack Daniel's be lying on me
Cause of that dude now you laying on me
Flame is rekindled now I’m trying homie
Don’t leave me dry when I’m high homie
You don’t how it feels to appear the weakling of your peers from a fear
That’s inconceivable to have yourself and to suddenly to let it

Go (gotta let us)

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Oh, nothing breaks like my heart

I heard you on a phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking (Yeah, it's smoking)
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that we fall apart
We're broken (We're broken)

Mmm, and nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now
[Chorus
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar (Crash in the dark)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Oh, nothing breaks like my heart
We'll leave each other cold as ice and high and dry
The desert wind is blowin' (Yeah, it's blowin')
Oh, remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

Oh, and nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now
And nothing, nothing, nothing

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar, oh (Crash in the dark)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like my heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like my heart

And nothing, nothing, nothing

Unbreak my heart, yeah

56,Lizzo,Bloodlines,"My great-grandmomma ain’t a slave
My great great great great great grandmother
Was a maid
I think that were just made of the same thing
Keeping it together, got the brave in the membrane

Ticky, tick tick that keeps you sane
Are the remnants reminiscing in my brain
1947 when he caught that train
And met my momma’s momma in the pouring rain
Ok, light skinned brother with the hazel eyes
Cause ain’t nobody messing with VJ
I got a sense of humor, I theorize
From everything he sent down my way
Bloodlines, like cousins like loving
It’s nothing. Put them down when its tough
And tie those loose ends to make them meet
Everything is gravy when your people live down the street
I see ya, so wait…
Take this before you escape
Don’t make the past feel like a mistake (repeat)
Swirling, black abyss
Stardust misting, raining down
Shining like the gems of eternity
Formulating for me and mine
Perhaps one day we can mine
Throwing all those minerals and chemical elements
Into the pot
Uh-oh we’re getting hot
Through some sun on the stove top
Close the lid, beware of the pop
Of the splash back
Add a dash of that acid
Voila
One day we’ll show our kids what we did the Big bang
Dearly beloved, we’re gathered here today
Witnessing something that we cannot explain
Dearly departed, we’re gather here today
Witnessing something that we cannot explain

57,Lizzo,A Change Is Gonna Come (One World: Together At Home),"I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, and just like the river, I've been running ever since

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

And I go to my brother
And I say, ""Brother, help me please""
And I pray he won't keep knockin' me
Down on my knees

There were times when I felt we couldn't last for long
But now I know I have all to carry on
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

Thank you to everyone working hard to keep us safe
Thank you to everyone staying home and keeping themselves safe
I love you, we got this

58,Lizzo,Rapture,"Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotised
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movements and a wild attack
Face to face, sadly solitude
And it's finger pop
It's 24-hour shopping in Rapture

Fab Five Freddie told me everybody fly
DJ's spinning I said my oh my
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
Francois sais pas, Flashe no deux
And you don't stop, sure shot
You go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and you drive real far
And you drive all night, then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run, but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
Then you're in the man from Mars
And you go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns, too, Mercuries and Subarus
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and you eat up bars
Where the people meet face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man, dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow, 'cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall, door to door
Hall to hall, he's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure
Take a tour, through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, just paint a train
And you'll be singin' in the rain
I said, don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
When the, uh, when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And he only eats guitars, get up
And he only eats guitars, get up
And he only eats guitars, get upEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

60,Lizzo,Make Way,"Something's got a hold on me
Drowning I can’t barely drink oh
Smoking I can barely breathe
Chopping up the royalty (oh)
They said that it’s a cold world
I tell them its my own world
And I’m about to pick the whole thing up
X2

You scare me
Cause there’s something darker hiding in disguise
Reminds me
That I’m exposed to be eaten alive
These cycles are liable
To go in circles, round about
What’s this about
Same drug different mouth
Same in different out
(This is my handle, this is my spout)
Now that’s I’m all steamed up
Just tip me over and pour me out
Gettin down and po'in up 3X
This ain't what you really want (repeat)
Pain leaves the body and the spirit wits
Substitute some whiskey for the Tylenol
Gotta keep this deal on going
If you feelin how I feel
So quit telling me you feel me
Cause can’t nobody feel
And quit telling us we’re famous
Cause we ain’t go no deal
And even if we did man
Then the industry ain’t real
Like I’m drinking and I’m driving
But my hand ain’t on the wheel
And I’m pressing on the gas
Cause I guess nobody will

67,Lizzo,!Truth hurts! Curse warning!,"Why are men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why are men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see 'em
It's OK, he already in my DMs
Why are men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay
I'ma hit you back in a minute
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it
We don't fuck with lies, we don't do goodbyes
We just keep it pushing like ay ay ay
I'ma hit you back in a minute
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it
We don't fuck with lies, we don't do goodbyes
We just keep it pushing like ay ay ay
Why are men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
