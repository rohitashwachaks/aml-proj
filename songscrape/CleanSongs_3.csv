0,Billie Eilish,​when the party’s over,"Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
"
1,Billie Eilish,​bad guy,"White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
"
2,Billie Eilish,​everything i wanted,"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
"
3,Billie Eilish,Happier Than Ever,"When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
"
4,Billie Eilish,​idontwannabeyouanymore,"Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
"
5,Billie Eilish,​bury a friend,"Billie

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
"
6,Billie Eilish,​i love you,"It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh

Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say ""I love you""
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry

Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say ""I love you""
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
"
7,Billie Eilish,Your Power,"Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

Mmm
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm
"
8,Billie Eilish,​wish you were gay,"""Baby, I don't feel so good,"" six words you never understood
""I'll never let you go,"" five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 ""heys"" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
"
9,Billie Eilish,No Time To Die,"I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh

Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry

10,Billie Eilish,Therefore I Am,"I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try)
I think, therefore, I am (I am)
I'm not your friend (Friend)
Or anything, damn (They wanna)
You think that you're the man (You're the man)

11,Billie Eilish,​​ocean eyes,"I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes

Fallin' into your ocean eyes

12,Billie Eilish,​my future,"I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go

Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans

'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I (I), I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself

I know supposedly I'm lonely now (Lonely now)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone (Someone)
But aren't I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer)
'Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again

But I (I), I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her (Ooh)
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here

13,Billie Eilish,​bellyache,"Mind
Mind

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)

Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better

14,Billie Eilish,​you should see me in a crown,"Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)
You say, ""Come over, baby
I think you're pretty""
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one


Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow

15,Billie Eilish,​xanny,"What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting

16,Billie Eilish,​all the good girls go to hell,"My Lucifer is lonely

Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

My Lucifer is lonely
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now
Haha!

17,Billie Eilish,​ilomilo,"Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

Hurry, I'm worried

The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

Hurry, I'm worried

Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home

18,Billie Eilish,COPYCAT,"Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour

19,Billie Eilish,​my strange addiction,"No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Did you like it? Did you like that?
"
20,Billie Eilish,​listen before i go,"Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)

If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm)

If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't save me now (Sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
"
21,Billie Eilish,​watch,"Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

Ooh, never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
"
22,Billie Eilish,​hostage,"I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec

And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage

Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you
Like a hostage

23,Billie Eilish,​my boy,"(Three and four and)
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm

My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off
(What?)

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (Who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy, my-my boy, my friends
I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
My boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My-my boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My boy, my (Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright, dude, go trip over a knife)

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine

24,Billie Eilish,Six Feet Under,"Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back
It won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife

Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again

Help, I lost myself again
"
25,Billie Eilish,Bored,"Ah, ah

The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run, ah

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need

I just want you to set me free

And when you walk out the door and leave me torn

26,Billie Eilish,8,"Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm

Da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm
You said, ""Don't treat me badly""
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

27,Billie Eilish,NDA,"Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh

You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (I think I hate it here)
Maybе I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars

28,Billie Eilish,​bitches broken hearts,"You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh , what a shame, I'm not there

What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art (Art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches' broken hearts
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
"
29,Billie Eilish,​​come out and play,"Hmm-mm

Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm

You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away

30,Billie Eilish,​​party favor,"Hey, leave a message

Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

""Stay"" and ""blah blah blah""
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
""It's not you, it's me"" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

You'll hear ""stay"" and ""blah blah blah""
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
""It's not you, it's me"" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?

31,Billie Eilish,6.18.18*,"Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know

I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're always on my mind
When I called a thousand times

Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th hell to pay
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go

More and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
You will never know

Don't leave﻿ me
Be

It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions

Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go ﻿to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?

33,Billie Eilish,Male Fantasy,"Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy

'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

(Want me to sing in here?)
(Okay)

I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

Can't get over you
No matter what I do

34,Billie Eilish,Oxytocin,"Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only pray on Sunday, could you come my way on Monday?
'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if She saw us

She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away

I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
I wanna make you yell (Yell)
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
Don't wanna treat you well (Well)

Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away

Bad things

I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you

35,Billie Eilish,Billie Bossa Nova,"Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Na-na-na

Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)

I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide

You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression (You sure do)
Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm

I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm ('Bout the way you look tonight)
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)

You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though (Torture though)
I know, I know
You better lock your door (Oh)
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)

36,Billie Eilish,The End of the World,"Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone

If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth, mmm
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me?
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me

If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agreed
"
37,Billie Eilish,Lost Cause,"Something's in the—

Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (You, you)
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew

I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong (Wrong)

You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job (Job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
I used to think you were shy (Shy)
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine (Mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
(So) So easy (So, so)
Hee, mm-mm-mm, mm

Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong (Wrong)

You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Yeah)
But you got no job (No job)
You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Think you're such a lost cause)
But you got no job

38,Billie Eilish,Halley’s Comet,"I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few

Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you

I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you

I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love
"
39,Billie Eilish,Getting Older,"I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm

Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna

Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I ain't really trippin' if you wanna go
I know I made you cry last year when I was on the road
I meant it when I said it, you can always hit my phone

41,Billie Eilish,WHEN I WAS OLDER,"When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm

I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be

I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah

When I was older

42,Billie Eilish,I Didn’t Change My Number,"Okay
Mm-mm, I

I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a ""You mad at me?"" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed

Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean

I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyеs)
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't dеserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend, too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news

43,Billie Eilish,Not My Responsibility,"Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?

To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone

""Everybody dies,"" that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone

I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?

That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone

Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes

You're looking at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

You said, ""Don't treat me badly""
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly

Boy, you never listen

I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
Time to come to terms, put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
I'm telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen

I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me

'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin’ sad
So don’t waste the time I don't have
And don’t try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you ’cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Mine

I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry

74,Billie Eilish,Thinkin Bout You (Cover),"A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they bawl when

I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

Or do you not think so far ahead

Mouth full of gum
In the driveway

In the back of my car

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)

Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake

Drag me down into your jealousy
Rising to inside your open mouth
Taking out your whole life on me

You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned

Don't tell me to come home, you must be stoned
Won't be wrapped up in your wings that spread with disaster
No, I'm not all those things you might be after
Maybe you're just too stoned to see you're the reason I don't come home
Too faded to see my heart's growin' blacker

So we moved together like a ball and chain
Minds becoming two halves of the same
It was real, and the shadows grew
Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
I would've shouted loud and broken through
I would've given it all to belong to you
But there were different plans, different rules
You said ""where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show you the way to the rest of my sins""
Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?

And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?

Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal

No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and a-stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight

102,Hank Williams,"Hey, Good Lookin’","Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
Hey, sweet baby - don't you think maybe
We can find us a brand new recipe?

I got a hot rod Ford, and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancing's free
So if you wanna have fun, come along with me

Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'?
How's about cooking somethin' up with me?



I'm free and ready, so we can go steady
How's about savin' all your time for me?
No more lookin', I know I been tookin'
Hows about keepin' steady company?
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
And buy me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it till it's covered with age
Cause I'm writin' your name down on ever' page

Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'?

103,Hank Williams,I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
"
104,Hank Williams,Jambalaya (On the Bayou),"Goodbye Joe me gotta go me oh my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a filé gumbo

105,Hank Williams,Your Cheatin’ Heart,"Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

Your cheatin' heart will pine someday
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

106,Hank Williams,"Precious Lord, Take My Hand","Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on
Let me stand
I'm tired, I am weak I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry
Hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet
Hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on
Let me stand
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
"
107,Hank Williams,Lost Highway,"I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
""Just another boy down the lost highway""

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway

Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
"
108,Hank Williams,Kaw-Liga,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standing by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no""
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart is made of knotty pine
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder, that his face is red?
Kaw-Liga, that poor old wooden head
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no""
And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her, oh, so far away but old Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be
And wishes he was still an old pine tree
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder, that his face is red?
"
109,Hank Williams,Settin’ the Woods on Fire,"Comb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
You're my gal and I'm your feller
Dress up in your frock of yeller
I'll look swell but you'll look sweller
Settin' the woods on fire
We'll take in all the honky tonks
Tonight we're having fun
We'll show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done
I don't care who thinks we're silly
You'll be daffy I'll be dilly
We'll order up two bowls of chili
Settin' the woods on fire
I'll gas up my hot rod stoker
We'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke but I'll be broker
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
We'll sit close to one another
Up one street and down the other
We'll have a time, oh brother
Settin' the woods on fire
We'll put aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My tires and tubes are doin' fine
But the air is showin' through
You clap hands and I'll start bowin'
We'll do all the law's allowin'
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin'
"
110,Hank Williams,"Cold, Cold Heart","I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
"
111,Hank Williams,Long Gone Lonesome Blues,"I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord
And then I jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue
I had me a woman who couldn't be true
She made me for my money and she made me blue
A man needs a woman that he can lean on
But my leanin' post is done left and gone
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue
I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, oh Lord
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue
She told me on Sunday she was checkin' me out
Long about Monday she was nowhere about
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news
I got them gone but not forgotten blues
"
112,Hank Williams,Ramblin’ Man,"I can settle down and be doin' just fine
'Til I hear an old train rollin' down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack
I love you baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man
Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see
Sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, He made a ramblin' man
I love to see the towns a-passin' by
And to ride these rails 'neath God's blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
Cause that's the life I believe, He meant for me
And when I'm gone and at my grave you stand
"
113,Hank Williams,I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive,"Now you're lookin' at a man that's gettin' kind-a mad
I had lots of luck but it's all been bad
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
My fishin' pole's broke the creek is full of sand
My woman run away with another man
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
A distant uncle passed away
And left me quite a batch
And I was living high until that fatal day
A lawyer proved I wasn't born, I was only hatched
Every thing's agin' me and it's got me down
If I jumped in the river I would probably drown
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
These shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time
Is full of holes and nails
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright no-how
No matter how I struggle and strive
"
114,Hank Williams,Move It on Over,"Came in last night at a half past ten
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
So move it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)

Move over nice dog cause a mad dog's moving in
She warned me once, she warned me twice
But I don't take no one's advice

Move over short dog cause a tall dog's moving in
She'll crawl back to me on her knees
I'll be busy scratching fleas
So slide it on over (move it on over)
Sneak it on over (move it on over)
Move over good dog cause a mad dog's moving in
Remember pup, before you whine
That side's yours and this side's mine
So shove it on over (move it on over)
Sweep it on over (move it on over)
"
115,Hank Williams,The Old Country Church,"There's a place near to me, where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went and our Sundays we spent
With our friends at the old country church
Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the old country church
How I wish that today all the people would pray
Like we prayed in that old country church
If they'd only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As He did in that old country church
Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the old country churchEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it

Well I'm standin' on a corner - With a bucket in my hand

117,Hank Williams,You Win Again,"The news is out all over town
That you've been seen a-runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do? You win again

I'm sorry for your victim now
'Cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain
And someday say you win again

You have no heart, you have no shame
You take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you, still you win againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
118,Hank Williams,Cool Water,"All day I've faced the barren waste
With out the taste of water... cool, water
Ole Dan and I, with throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water... cool, clear water
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water... cool, clear water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on
To water... cool, clear water
The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water.... cool, clear water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where
There's water... cool, clear water
Keep a-movin' Dan. Don't you listen to him Dan
He's the devil, not a man
He spreads the burnin' sand with water
Say Dan can't you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
It's waiting there for you and me
And water.... cool, clear water
Dan's feet are sore he's yearnin' for
Just one thing more than water.... cool, clear water
Like me I guess he'd like to rest
Where there's no quest
"
119,Hank Williams,Alone and Forsaken,"We met in the springtime
When blossoms unfold
The pastures were green
And the meadows were gold

Our love was in flower
As summer grew on
Her love, like the leaves
Now has withered and gone

The roses have faded
There's frost at my door
The birds in the morning
Don't sing anymore

The grass in the valley
Is starting to die
And out in the darkness
The whip-poor-wills cry

Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh, lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh, please understand
Oh, where has she gone to
Oh, where can she be?
She may have forsaken
Some other like me

She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow was a plaything
That she threw away

The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance
Is starting to bay

I wonder, I wonder
What she's thinking of?
Forsaken, forgotten
Without any love
"
120,Hank Williams,A House Of Gold,"People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
Don't they know on the judgement day
That their gold and silver will melt away

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

Jesus said, come on to me
I'll break sin's chains and set you free
I'll carry you to a home on high
Where you'll never, never die

What good is gold and silver, too
When your heart's not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Jesus died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Sinner hear now what I say
For someday you'll have to pay
What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not good and true
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and prayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

122,Hank Williams,Mind Your Own Business,"If the wife and I are fussin', brother, that's our right
'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight

Why don't you mind your own business?
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine

Oh, the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring

Why don't you mind your own business?
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine


I got a little gal that wears her hair up high
The boys all whistle when she walks by

Why don't you mind your own business?
Mind your own business
Well, if you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine

If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three
Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me

Just mind your own business
Mind your own business
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine


Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned
I got all that I can do just to mind my own

Why don't you mind your own business?
Mind your own business
If you mind your own business, you'll stay busy all the timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
123,Hank Williams,Dust On The bible,"I went into a home one day just to see some friends of mine
Of all their books and magazines, not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a fingerprint was plain
Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
Oh, you can read your magazines of love and tragic things
But not one word of Bible verse, not a scripture do you know
When it is the very truth and it's contents good for you
But it's dust is covered o'er it
And it's sure to doom your poor soul
Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets, and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
Oh, if you have a friend you'd like to help along life's way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burdens light
Is to dust the family bible trades the wrong way for the right
Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets, and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
124,Hank Williams,Why Don’t You Love Me (Like You Used to Do),"Well, why don't you love me like you used to do
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile

Why don't you spark me like you used to do
And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So, why don't you love me like you used to do

Well, why don't you be just like you used to be
How come you find so many faults with me
Somebody's changed so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile
Why don't you say the things you used to say
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue

126,Hank Williams,Tramp On The Street,"Only a tramp was Lazarus sad fate
He who lay down at the rich man's gate
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
He was only a tramp found dead on the street
He was some mother's darlin', he was some mother's son
Once he was fair and once he was young
And some mother rocked him, her darlin' to sleep
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street
Jesus, he died on Calvary's tree
He shed his life's blood for you and for me
They pierced his side and then his feet
And they left him to die like a tramp on the street
He was Mary's own darlin', he was god's chosen son
Once he was fair and once he was young
Mary, she rocked him, her darlin' to sleep
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street
If Jesus should come and knock on your door
For a place to come in, or bread from your store
Would you welcome him in, or turn him away
Then the god's would deny you on the great judgment dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
127,Hank Williams,A Mansion on the Hill,"Tonight down here in the valley
I'm lonesome, and oh, how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill


Do you recall when we parted?
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill


I've waited all through the years, love
To give you a heart true and real
'Cause I know you're living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill

The light shine bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride, dear
"
128,Hank Williams,I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still in Love with You),"Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
129,Hank Williams,Wedding Bells,"I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
But dear I hope you're happy just the same
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing out for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bell will never ring for me
I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
I hear the children laughing out with glee
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And while the organ plays I love you truly
Please let me pretend that I am there
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another
But wedding bells will never ring for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
130,Hank Williams,Howlin’ at the Moon,"I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in
I can't even spell my name, my heads in such a spin
To-day I tried to eat a steak with a big old table-spoon
You got me chasin' rabbits, walkin' on my hands and howlin' at the moon
Well, I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had
Now I can't tell the day from night, I'm crazy as a loon
You got me chasin' rabbits, pullin' out my hair and howlin' at the moon
Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin' spree
Cause there ain't a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me
I ate three bones for dinner today, then tried to tree a 'coon
You got me chasin' rabbits, scratchin' fleas and howlin' at the moon
I rode my horse to town to day and a gas pump we did pass
I pulled 'im up and I hollered whoa, said fill 'im up with gas
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham, he changed my tune
You got me chasin' rabbits, spittin' out teeth and howlin' at the moon
I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard
But honey baby, when I fell the whole world must have jarred
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if you'd take me for your groom

131,Hank Williams,Take These Chains from My Heart,"Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care
For the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

133,Hank Williams,How Can You Refuse Him Now,"How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
There's a story old, that has often been told
Of how our Saviour died, as they nailed His hands
He cried they don't understand
As the blood flowed from His side
How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
As He hung there on the tree, He prayed for you and me
There was no one His pain to ease
Before He died, He faintly cried
Father forgive them please
How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
134,Hank Williams,(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle,"I was ridin' number nine
Headin' south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
Got in trouble had to roam
Left my gal and left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
Just a kid actin' smart
I went and broke my darlin's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
When the ev'nin' train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell
Til my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time
I heard that lonesome whistle blowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
135,Hank Williams,There’s A Tear In My Beer,"There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear
You are on my lonely mind
Into these last nine beers
I have shed a million tears
You are on my lonely mind

I'm gonna keep drinkin' until I'm petrified
And then maybe these tears will leave my eyes

There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear
You were on my lonely mind

Last night I walked the floor
And the night before
You were on my lonely mind
It seems my life is through
And I'm so doggone blue
You are on my lonely mind

I'm gonna keep drinkin' 'til I can't move a toe
And then maybe my heart won't hurt me so
There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear
You were on my lonely mind

Lord, I've tried and I've tried
But my tears, I can't hide
You are on my lonely mind
All these blues that I've found
Have really got me down
You are on my lonely mind

I'm gonna keep drinkin' 'til I can't even think
'Cause in the last week, I ain't slept a wink

There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear
You were on my lonely mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
136,Hank Williams,Gathering Flowers for the Master’s Bouquet,"Death is an angel sent down from above sent for the buds of the flowers we love
But every bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as a flower in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet beautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by angels then carried away forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet
Loved ones are passing each day and each hour passing away as the life of a flower

Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet...beautiful flowers that will never decay

137,Hank Williams,The Angel Of Death,"In the great book of John
You're warned of the day
When you'll be laid
Beneath the cold clay
The Angel of Death
Will come from the sky
And claim up your soul
When the time comes to die
When the Angel of Death
Comes down after you
Can you smile and say
That you have been true
Can you truthfully say
With your dying breath
That you're ready to meet
The Angel of Death
When the lights all grow dim
And the dark shadows creep
And then your lived ones
Are gathered to weep
Can you face them and say
With your dying breath
That you're ready to meet
The Angel of Death
When the Angel of Death
Comes down after you
Can you smile and say
That you have been true
Can you truthfully say
With your dying breath
That you're ready to meet

138,Hank Williams,Be Careful Of Stones That You Throw,"A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw
A neighbor was passing my garden
One time, she stopped and I knew right away
That it was gossip not flowers she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say
""That bad girl down the street should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to me or my child""
My neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw
A car speeded by and the screaming of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still
The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
""Oh who was that brave girl so sweet?""
I covered the crushed broken body and sad
The bad girl who lived down the street
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throwEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
139,Hank Williams,Dear John,"Well when I woke up this mornin'
There was a note upon my door
Said don't make me no coffee Babe
'cause I won't be back no more
And that's all she wrote, Dear John
I've sent your saddle home
Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale
Daniel in the lion's den
But I know a guy that didn't try to get along
And he won't get a chance again
And that's all she wrote, Dear John
I've fetched your saddle home
Well she didn't forward no address
Nor she didn't say goodbye
All she said was if you get blue
Just hang your little head and cry
And that's all she wrote, Dear John
I've sent your saddle home
Now my gal's short and stubby
She's strong as she can be
But if that little old gal of mine
Ever get's a-hold of me
That's all she wrote, Dear John
I've sent your saddle home
Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale
Daniel in the lion's den
But I know a man that didn't try to get along
And he won't get a chance again
And that's all she wrote, Dear John
I've fetched your saddle home
Now I went down to the bank this morning
The cashier said with a grin
I feel so sorry for you Hank
But your wife has done been in
And that's all she wrote, Dear John
I've sent your saddle homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
140,Hank Williams,The Funeral,"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew
Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips
Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race
And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above
The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan
Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrows way
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground
And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long
And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us prayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
141,Hank Williams,Men With Broken Hearts,"You'll meet many just like me upon life's busy street
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low
And eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
You've never walked in that man's shoes
Or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands
While the heart inside you dies
Some were paupers some were kings
And some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same
These men with broken hearts
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where he starts
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken heartsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
142,Hank Williams,When God Dips His Love in My Heart,"When God dips His pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul the message He wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine
When God dips His love in my heart
I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation when He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide
Such love as Jesus did impart
It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart
He walked every step up Calvary's ragged way
And He gave His life completely to bring a better day
My life was lost in sinned but in love He took me in
His blood washed all my sins away
I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation when He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide
Such love as Jesus did impart
It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

144,Hank Williams,No One Will Ever Know,"No one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll miss you but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And realized our dreams could never be
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me
No one will ever know how much I'm pineing
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No one will ever see the tears I'm hiding
You've hurt me but no one will ever know
I'll tell then I found true love with another
That I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
145,Hank Williams,On Top Of Old Smoky,"On top of old Smokey, all covered in snow
I lost my true lover, by courtin' too slow
On top of old Smokey, I went there to weep
For a false hearted lover, is worse than a thief
A thief he will rob you, and take what you save
But a false hearted lover, will put you in your grave
On top of old Smokey, all covered in snow
I lost my true lover, by courtin' too slow
They'll hug you and kiss you, then tell you more lies
Than the crossties on the railroad, or the stars in the skies
On top of old Smoke, all covered in snow
I lost my true lover, by courtin' too slowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

147,Hank Williams,I’m So Tired Of It All,"All my life I've been so lonesome
If happiness came, I missed the call
All my dreams have died and vanished
And now I'm so tired of it all
In life and love, I've been a failure
Too many tears thru it all
Too many broken vows and promises
And now I'm so tired of it all

Too many times I've watched my castles fall
My life is full of regretting
And now I'm so tired of it all

No one will miss me, after all
Up there, I pray I'll find contentment
But now I'm so tired of it allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
148,Hank Williams,Thirty Pieces of Silver,"Tis a sad but true story
From the bible it came
And it tells us how Judas
Sold the savior in shame
He planned with the council
Of high priest that day
30 pieces of silver
Was the price they would pay
30 pieces of silver
30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus
On the cross he was slain
Betrayed and forsaken
Unloved and unclaimed
In anger they pierced him
But he died not in vein
Twas on there on the hillside
The multitude came
And found our dear savoir
Then took him away
They bruised and mocked him
Thorns was crowned around his head
And his garment of purple
Showed the blood stains of red
Far off in the mountains with his face towards the sun
Judas begged merci for what he had done
He gave back the silver
For his heart filled with strife
Then there in the mountain he took his own life
30 pieces of silver
30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus
On the cross he was slainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you
Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope
Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done
Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy
I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you
In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

My son calls another man daddy
The right to his love I've been denied
My son calls another man daddy
He'll never know my name nor my face
God only knows, how it hurts me
For another to be in my place
Each night I laid there in prison
I pictured a future so bright
For he was the one ray of sunshine
That shone through the darkest of nights
Today his mother shares a new love
She just couldn't stand my disgrace
My son calls another man daddy
And longs for the love, he can't replace
My son calls another man daddy
He'll never know my name nor my face
God only knows how it hurts me
For another to be in my placeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

158,Hank Williams,Have I Told You Lately That I Love You,"Have I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you once again somehow
Have I told you how with all my heart and soul I need you
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
My heart would break in two if I should lose you I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream that I dream is you somehow
And have I told you how my every thought is in your keeping
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
My world would end today if I should lose you
Because I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you
Well, darling, I'm telling you nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
159,Hank Williams,Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,"In the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dyin' ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin'
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

161,Hank Williams,Pictures From Life’s Other Side,"In the world's mighty gallery of pictures
Hang the scenes that're painted from life
There's pictures of love and of passion
And there's pictures of keys and of strife
There hung pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old age and a blushing young bride
They all hung on the wall but the saddest of all
Are the pictures from life's other side
Just a picture from life's other side
Someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day
There's a poor old mother at home
She's watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a picture from life's other side
The first scene is that of a gambler
Who had lost all of his money at play
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side
Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a heartbroken mother and baby
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
On an outcast, soon no one will save
And yet she was once a true woman
She was somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep
"

Every time you get mad
You pack your rags and go back to Dad

Change the things you do
Stop doin' all the things that you oughtn't do

164,Hank Williams,Pan American,"I have heard your stories about your fast trains
But now I'll tell you about one all the southern folks have seen
She's the beauty of the southlands listen to that whistle scream

165,Hank Williams,Someday You’ll Call My Name,"Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
Someday you'll reach for me I won't be there
For you've grown tired of all the love I gave you
But someday you'll wish that I still care
All these years how I've loved you
Still I know I claim you for my own
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
For someday you'll find yourself alone
When you hair has turned from Gold to Silver
And your eyes are dimmed by passing years
You'll remember darling what I told you
There'll be no one then to dry your tears
There'll come a time in your life dear
When you'll need someone who will care
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer

166,Hank Williams,Nobody’s Lonesome for Me,"Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's thinkin' 'bout somebody else
But nobody thinks about me
When the time rolls around for me to lay down and die
I bet I'll have to go and hire me someone to cry
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
Nobody is lonesome for me

Everybody's longin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's dreamin' about somebody else
But nobody dreams about me
All I need is a bride who wants a big-hearted groom
I wouldn't care if she come ridin' in on a broom
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
Nobody lonesome for me


Everybody's pinin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's crazy 'bout somebody else
But nobody's crazy 'bout me
Oh, I shined up my shoes, and then I slicked down my hair
Put on my Sunday suit, but I ain't goin' nowhere
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's yearnin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's fallin' for somebody else
But nobody's fallin' for me
Now I ain't had a kiss since I fell out of my crib
It looks to me like I been cheated out of my rib
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else

That's why we're so far apart
You made your world out of vows that are broken
I built a world in my heart
Everyone here tried to warn me
You were just playing a game
I told them all we were meant for each other
I thought our worlds were the same
If you stay over in your world
Oh, how my poor heart will pine

Won't you come over in mine
We live in two different worlds, dear
My world is honest and true
Sweetheart, remember when your world gets lonesome
I'll still be waiting for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
170,Hank Williams,Wealth Won’t Save Your Soul,"As we journey along on life's wicked road
So selfish are we for silver and gold
You can treasure your wealth, your diamonds and gold
But my friend, it won't save your poor wicked soul
For when God calls from His home up on high
To your earthly wealth you must say goodbye
Then it's useless to you if you've strayed from the fold
For my friend, it won't save your poor wicked soul
The rich man like all will be judged at that time
But all of his wealth will be left behind
For no matter how much earthly wealth you get hold
My friend, it won't save your poor wicked soul

It's a sin to make me cry
When you know I love you so
I could tell my heart that I don't miss you
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know
I could give you all the blame
But I'm sure the truth would show
I could tell this world I've found a new love
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know
I can't fool my cryin' heart

I knew you couldn't win, I told you from the start
Go on and break, you crazy heart

173,Hank Williams,At the First Fall of Snow,"I talked with a stranger, so sad and alone
His garments were sackled, all tattered and torn
He told me a story of sorrow and woe
His heart went to heaven at the first fall of snow

He spoke of his angel, a dear baby girl
He loved every footstep, he loved every curl
But she went to heaven just one year ago
The angels came for her at the first fall of snow

He still had the dolly that she used to love
He held and caressed it and gazed up above
He whispered, ""My baby, you're waiting, I know
I'll bring you your dolly at the first fall of snow""

And there as I listened, my eyes filled with tears
I knew she was part of his happier years
His frail body trembled, he spoke soft and low
""I'll be with my baby at the first fall of snow""

I patted his shoulder, my feelings to hide
He couldn't know I was crying inside
He smiled as we parted 'cause he didn't know

Six more miles and leave my darlin'
Leave the best friend, I ever had
Oh I hear the train a-comin'
Bringin' my darlin' back home
Six more miles, to the graveyard
And I'll be left here all a- lone
Six more miles to the graveyard
Six more miles, long and sad

There is one who's smiling face the Gods would see
Cause she'll walk along beside me up to golden stairs
Oh they'll never never take her love from me
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And to see her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh they'll never never take her love from me
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in a caress
But they'll never never take her love from me
I thought I'd make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the day that she became another's bride
I'll say they'll never never take her love from me
No they'll never never take her love from meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
176,Hank Williams,I’ve Been Down That Road Before,"Now friends if you'll just listen to me
You'll get some good hard earned advice
I don't aim to meddle in your business
I'm just trying to save ya an awful price
You see these teeth that I ain't got
And these knots on my bald head
I'll guaranty you boys I didn't get um'
There a lyin' home in bed
Now take the smart-Aleck in any town
Of him folks want no part
He acts like his head was only
Made to hold his ears apart
Now he might not like what I'm bout to say
And my words might make him sore
But I'm just trying to be helpful
'Cause I been down that road before
To bully folks and play mean tricks
Was once my pride and joy
Till one day I was toted home
And mama didn't know her little boy
My head was swelled up so doggone big
I couldn't get it through my front door
Now I ain't just talkin' ta hear myself
I been down that road before
A little fella about my size
Got tired of bein' pushed about
So he went to work and when he got through
He'd knocked everyone of my teeth out
One time too many I rubbed him wrong
And he evened up the score
Now that's what happens when you get too big for your britches
I been down that road before
Now when you get to thinking your really smart
There's somebody smarter then you
And no matter how much you boast and brag
You can still learn a thing or two
Go get you some treatments just like I've had
And you won't hanker for more
I've really learned the meaning of living and loving
'Cause I've been down that road before
Now the man that walks this rocky road
Usually gets just what he deserves
But he's just a helpless servant
To a master that he servers
Now I've learned to slow my temper down
And not to pick no scraps no more
Boys its a lot easier on the head and the eyes
'Cause I've been down that road beforeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
177,Hank Williams,The Prodigal Son,"A prodigal son once strayed from his father
To travel a land of hunger and pain
And now I can see the end of my journey
I'm going to Heaven again
I leave you the day to help all your neighbors
I leave you the night to solemnly pray
So try to repent and ask for forgiveness
We'll meet up in Heaven, someday
Goodbye to this world, with all of its sorrows
Goodbye to the fields that I used to roam
I'm going away where life is eternal
My Shepherd is callin' me home
From out of the sky, He's coming to meet me
To wash all my sins and call me His own
His servants will bring a ring for my finger
And never no more will I roam
And now I must go back home to my Maker
Where kindness and love will make us as one
So try to be strong if you're ever tempted
Just remember the prodigal sonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

But now your conscience bothers you you've reached your journey's end
You're asking me for sympathy well I'm sorry for you my friend
You laughed inside each time she cried you tried to make her blue
She tugged along through right and wrong because she worshipped you
You know that you're the one to blame there's no use to pretend
Today's the day you start to pay I'm sorry for you my friend
Today as she walked arm in arm at someone else's side
It made you stop and realize that time has turned the tide
You should have known you'd be alone cause cheaters never win
You tried and lost now pay the cost I'm sorry for you my friendEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

180,Hank Williams,Everything’s Okay,"I went to the country just the other day
To see my uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away
I asked him how he'd been since last, I'd passed his way
He rubbed his chin, here's what he had to say
My wife's been sick, the young ones, too
And I'm darn near down with the flu
The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died
The bees got mad and they left the hive
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
The porch rotted down that's more expense
The darned old mule he tore down the fence
The mortgage is due and I can't pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
My land's so poor so hard and yeller
You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller
And it rains out here nearly every day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water
Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter
My helper, he quit for the lack of pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
The house it leaks it needs a new top
When it rains it wets everything we got
The chimney fell down just yesterday
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
The corn meals gone and the meat's run out
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse
The preacher's comin' Sunday to spend the day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
The canned stuffs spoiled else the jar's got broke
And all we got left is one old Billy goat
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of may
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay
My crop it rotted in the ground
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down
But we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days
So after all, everything's in pretty good shapeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon

Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last
Turn the pages of your Bible, in St. Matthew you will see
Start with chapter twenty-four and read from one to thirty-three
In our Savior's blessed words He said on earth, He prophesised
For He spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by
All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair
He has said ""Be ye not troubled for these things shall come to pass.""
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last

There'll be nation against nation, there'll be war and rumor of war
There'll be great signs in Heaven, in the sun, the moon, the stars
Oh, the hearts of men shall fail them, there'll be gnashing of the teeth
Those who seek it will receive it, mercy at the Savior's feetEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Your smile is heaven's work of art
But now you're smiling at another
And there's pins and needles in my heart
Someday, somewhere I'll find you
And love will make the teardrops start
And then you'll know how long I've waited
With these pins and needles in my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
188,Hank Williams,Lost On The River,"Lost on the river
Dark is the night
Just like the blind
Praying for sight
Drifting alone
Heart filled with strife
I'm lost on the river
The river of life

Once dear I thought
I knew the way
But that was before
Old sad yesterday
Words that you told me
Cut like a knife
I'm lost on the river
The river of life

Out on this river
Where sorrow creeps
Thinking of you
And how my heart weeps
Tomorrow you'll be
Another man's wife
And I'm lost on the river
The river of lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
189,Hank Williams,From Jerusalem to Jericho,"From Jerusalem to Jericho, along that lonely road
A certain man was set upon and robbed of all his gold
They beat him and they stripped him, and they left him there for dead
Who was it then that come along and bathed the aching head?
Then who (then who), tell me who (tell me who)
Tell me who was this neighbor kind and true?
From Jerusalem to Jericho we're traveling every day
And many are the fallen ones that lie along the way
From Jerusalem to Jericho, a certain priest come by
He heard the poor man crying, but he heeded not the cry
He gathered his robes about him and he quickly passed away
Who was it then that come along and ministered that day?
Then who (then who), tell me who (tell me who)
Tell me who was this neighbor kind and true?
From Jerusalem to Jericho we're traveling every day
And many are the fallen ones that lie along the way
From Jerusalem to Jericho, a Levite came along
He heard the poor man crying, that lie upon the ground
He lifted his hands up to the heavens and he quickly passed him by
Who was it then that came along and heeded that needy cry?
Then who (then who), tell me who (tell me who)
Tell me who was this neighbor kind and true?
From Jerusalem to Jericho we're traveling every day
And many are the fallen ones that lie along the way
From Jerusalem to Jericho, when life was ebbing away
Along come that Samaritan who was despised, they say
He ministered to the dying man, he carried him to an inn
He paid his fare and told the host to take good care of him
Then who (then who), tell me who (tell me who)
Tell me who was this neighbor kind and true?
From Jerusalem to Jericho we're traveling every day
And many are the fallen ones that lie along the way
From Jerusalem to Jericho, a-traveling every day
And many are the fallen ones that lie along the way
Oh, some despised and some rejected, but it's no matter how they've been
When everybody turns you down, then Jesus takes you inEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
190,Hank Williams,Wait for the Light to Shine,"When the road is rocky and you're carrying the load
Wait for the light to shine
If you find you're friendless on that weary lonesome road
Wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine
Pull yourself together and keep looking for the sign
Wait for the light to shine
Don't forget your brother as you travel through this land
Wait for the light to shine
He may be in trouble and may need a helping hand
Wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine
Never give up hope or cast your pearls and pour this wine
Wait for the light to shine

Don't let trouble fool you and your sin will all be gone
Wait for the light to shine
Don't forget his darkness just before the break of dawn
Wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine
Keep these words on your mind as you walk out narrow line
Wait for the light to shineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
191,Hank Williams,I Just Don’t Like This Kind of Living,"I just don't like this kind of livin'
I'm tired of doin' all the givin'
I give my all and sit and yearn
And get no lovin' in return
And I just don't like this kind of livin'

Why do we stay together
We always fuss and fight
You ain't never known to be wrong
And I ain't never been right

Tell me where you think we're goin'
Cause I ain't got no way of knowin'
When things go wrong, you go your way
You leave me here, to pay and pay
And I just don't like this kind of livin'

I just don't like the things you're doin'
Your evil heart will be your ruin
When things start runnin' smooth and free
You haul right off and you pick on me
And I just don't like this way of livin'
They say the road of love is long
It's rocky and it's rough
But if this road don't start to get smooth
I've traveled it long enough

Why don't you act a little older
And get that chip off of your shoulder
I've told you once, now I'll tell you twice
You better start to treat me nice
'Cause I just don't like this way of livin'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
192,Hank Williams,I Dreamed About Mama Last Night,"I've just been to heaven with someone so true
I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night
She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away
We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key
For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said
And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went to sleep
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep
I dreamed about mama last nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
193,Hank Williams,Wild Side Of Life,"You wouldn't read my letter if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I've wanted to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song
I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels
But I should have known you'd never make a wife
You cheated the only one that ever loved you
And then went back to the wild side of life
The glamor of the gay night life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
WYou broke each sacred vow that you made me
And gave up the truest love you'll ever know
I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels
But I should have known you'd never make a wife
You cheated the only one that ever loved you
And then went back to the wild side of lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
194,Hank Williams,Help Me Understand,"A little girl prayed at the close of the day
Cause her daddy had gone far away
On her little face was a look of despair
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer
My mommie says daddy has brought us to shame
And I'm never no more to mention his name
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly Father help me understand

You know friends I wonder--
Just how many homes are broken tonight
And just how many tears are shed
By some little word of anger
That never should have been said
I'd like to tell you a story
Of a family I once knew
We'll call them Mary and William
And their little daughter Sue
Now Mary was just a plain mother
And Bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels
(like everybody else)
But neither one really got mad
Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another
And the last word led to a divorce
Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense
You know she didn't ask to be brought to
This world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most
There's be a lot more honest loving
In this wicked ole world today
If just a few parted parents
Could hear little Sue say

Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly Father, help me understandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
195,Hank Williams,I’ve Just Told Mama Goodbye,"Each year on Mother's day
The rose I wore was red
But today I'm saying my first prayer
Mama's lying on her dying bed
I've just told Mama goodbye
Mother's day has turned to night
Like the flowers in May, she withered away
And my red rose is turning white
This is the dreaded hour
We all must face someday
Yet there's consolation in my heart
She will bloom in the Master's bouquet
Her time has come to go
And there's nothing I can do
Only hold her hand and say goodbye
Mama's day with her children is through
I've just told Mama goodbye
And knelt beside her bed
I heard her say, ""I'll meet you someday
Where the white roses turn to red.""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
196,Hank Williams,Calling You,"When you've strayed from the fold
And there's trouble in your soul
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
When your soul is lost in sin
And you're at your journey's end
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
Callin' You?, (Callin' You?)
Callin' You?, (Callin' You?)
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
He will take you by the hand
Lead you to that promise land
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
As you journey day by day
And temptation comes your way
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
If you'll follow in His light
He will always guide you right
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
Callin' You?, (Callin' You?)
Callin' You?, (Callin' You?)
When your soul is burdened down
And your friend(s) can not be found
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
If you'll follow Him each day
He will brighten up your way
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
197,Hank Williams,Message To My Mother,"The struggle for life would soon be over
A young man on his death bed lay
He raised his head in dying anger
And this is what I heard him say

Take this message to my mother
It will fill her heart with joy
Tell her that I've met my Savior
God has saved her wandering boy

The tears and sorrow I have caused her
How I wish I could repay
But tell her I'll be waiting for her
We'll meet in heaven some glad day

How she cried when I left her
I know it filled her heart with pain
She said son please don't leave me
For we may never meet again

Years have passed since that parting
But I know she waits and prays
Soon I'll cross that dark river
Please let her know that I was savedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
198,Hank Williams,I Won’t Be Home No More,"Well, you're just in time to be too late
I tried to but I couldn't wait
And now I've got another date
So I won't be home no more
You're just in time to miss the boat
So don't take off your hat and coat
Be on your way, that's all she wrote
'Cause I won't be home no more
I stood around a month or two
And waited for your call
Now I'm too busy pitchin' woo
So come around next fall
I scratched your name right off my slate
And hung a sign on my front gate
You're just in time to be too late
And I won't be home no more
Well, you're just in time to turn around
And drive your buggy back to town
You looked me up I turned you down
And I won't be home no more
You're just in time to change your tune
Go tell your troubles to the moon
And call around next May or June
'Cause I won't be home no more
I used to be the patient kind
Believed each alibi
But that's all done, I've changed my mind
I've got new fish to fry
Well, you're just in time to celebrate
The things you didn't calculate
You're just in time to be too late
And I won't be home no moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
199,Hank Williams,May You Never Be Alone,"Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight
I'm alone and, oh, so blue tonight
Like a lil' piece of driftwood on the sea
May you never be alone like me
I believed the lies you told to me
When you whispered, ""Dear, I worship thee""
Now here am I, alone and blue
All because I loved no one but you
I gave up my friends, I left my home
When you promised to be mine alone
Now you're gone, our love could never be
May you never be alone like me
In the Bible, God's own words do say
For every wrong some day you'll pay
I pray the Lord to set me free
May you never be alone like meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
