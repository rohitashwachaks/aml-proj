0,Patti Smith,Gloria (In Excelsis Deo),"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Melting in a pot of thieves wild card up my sleeve
Thick, heart of stonemy sins my own
They belong to me. Me
People said beware but I don't care
Their words are just rules and regulations to me. Me
I walk in a room you know I look so proud
I move in this here atmosphere where anything's allowed
Then I go to this here party and I just get bored
Until I look out the window see a sweet young thing
Humping on a parking meter leaning on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good. Oh, she looks so fine
And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to make her mine
Oh I'll put my spell on her here she comes
Walking down the street here she comes
Coming through my door here she comes
Crawling up my stair here she comes
Waltzing through the hall in a pretty red dress
And oh, she looks so good. Oh, she looks so fine
And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to make her mine
Then I hear this knocking on my door hear this knocking on my door
And I look up to the big tower clock and say oh my God it's midnight
And my baby is walking through the door laying on my couch
She whispers to me and I take the big plunge
And oh, she was so good. And oh, she was so fine
And I'm going to tell the world that I just made her mine
And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is
G L O R I -
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
I was at the stadium. There were two thousand girls
Called their names out to me Marie Ruth but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them. I didn't see. I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chiming in my heart going ding-dong
Ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong
Ding-dong. Calling the time when you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh, you were so good. Oh, you were so fine
And I've got to tell the world that I made ya mine, made ya mine
Made her mine made ya mine made her mine made ya mine
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
When the tower bells chime
Ding-dong they chime
I said that Jesus died
For somebody's sins
But not mine
Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria

1,Patti Smith,Land: Horses/Land of a Thousand Dances/La Mer (De),"Horses
The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea (A glass of tea)
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
(His gold nerves merged perfectly with the hallway)
He merged perfectly with the hallway
(A radiant light, an aura around the mirror merged and looked at Johnny)
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway
(Fastened, in the kitchen)
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run
But the movie kept moving as planned
(Johnny wanted to run but the movie kept moving as planned)
The boy took Johnny (The boy took Johnny), he pushed him against the locker (He pushed him against the locker)
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny (He drove it in, he drove it home)
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees
Started crashing his head against the locker
Started crashing his head against the locker
Started laughing hysterically
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining silver studs with their nose in flames
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses
Land of A Thousand Dances
Do you know how to pony like Bony Maroney?
Do you know how to twist? Well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato
Do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, I dig your baby sister
And rise up on her knees
Do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee
Roll down on her back
Got to lose control, got to lose control
Got to lose control and then you take control
Then you're rolled down on your back
And you like it like that, like it like that, like it like that, like it like that
And then you do the Watusi, yeah do the Watusi
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there in his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, ""Oh, pretty boy can't you show me nothing but surrender?""
And Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket
Taped to his chest there's the answer
You got pen knives and jack knives and switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
""Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain""
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud and go, Johnny, go, and do the Watusi, oh do the Watusi
There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks
Across the tracks and the name of the place is
You like it like that, you like it like that
You like it like that, you like it like that
And the name of the band is
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Baby calm down, better calm down
On the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair
And I didn't waste time, I just walked right up
And saw that up there, there is a sea (He's always staring)
Up there there is a sea, up there there is a sea
The sea's the possibility (And in to time, he walked right up)
There is no land but the land (Up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea (Up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key (Up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities (Up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me (There is a sea, there is a sea of possibilities)
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(In a sea of possibilities, up there, there is a) I felt his hand on my knee
(On the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of coral flame
(In the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(The spoon)
And let it dip in
(The veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire, that
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a Brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the Watusi
Yeah do the Watusi, do the Watusi
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers
(I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I—I that's how I
That's how I
I died
(At that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
(They knew what they were after)
 moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility (No possibility, no possibility, no possibility)
(The possibilities) Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land
La Mer De
Looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
That went streaming through the sands like fingers
Like arteries, like fingers
(How much fits between the eyes of a horse?)
He lay, pressing it against his throat (Your eyes)
He opened his throat (Your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (Of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (And my heart) was so high (My heart) pitched that nobody heard
No one heard that cry
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat
(His fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly
(Throat) And so he seized the first
(His vocal chords shot up)
(The closest possibility)
(Mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(There is nothin' happening at all)
And go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
Saw this sweet young thing (Fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter
In the sheets, there was a man
Dancing around to the simple
"
2,Patti Smith,Birdland,"His father died and left him a little farm in New England
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night
It was as if someone had spread butter
On all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip
Then he put his head in the crux of his arms
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy behind the control board
Streaming beads of light
He saw his daddy behind the control board
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human
The little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out
No, daddy, don't leave me here alone
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you are not human, you are not human
But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm
Nobody there except for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of
A shaman bouquet. Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck, all his limbs
Everything was twisted and he said:
I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast
Take me up quick. take me up, up to the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it
Where I am not human
I am helium raven and this movie is mine
So he cried out as he stretched the sky
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon
Am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
It won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear them now
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships
They were moving in, streams of them
And he put up his hands and he said:
It's me, it's me, I'll give you my eyes, take me up
Oh now please take me up, I'm helium raven
Waiting for you, please take me up, don't leave me here!
The son, the sign, the cross, like the shape of a tortured woman
The true shape of a tortured woman, the mother standing
In the doorway letting her sons, no longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet
He's going to run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull, it's gonna come out
Like a black bouquet shining, like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer, take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up up, take me up I'll go up I'm going up I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship. Let the ship slide open
We'll go inside of it where we are not human we're not human
Well, there was sand, there were tiles
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface, he saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot, and then he saw raven coming in
And he crawled on his back and he went up up up up up up up
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way
"
3,Patti Smith,Redondo Beach,"Late afternoon dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel that sent you away
I was looking for you are you gone gone
Called you on the phone another dimension
Well you never returned oh you know what I mean
I went looking for you are you gone gone
Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description oh I was looking for you
Everyone was singing girl is washed up
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad
I was looking for you are you gone gone
Pretty little girl everyone cried
She was the victim of sweet suicide
I went looking for you are you gone gone
Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description oh I was looking for you
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up
Was small and angel with apple blonde hair now
I went looking for you are you gone gone
Picked up my key didn't reply
Went to my room started to cry
You were small and angel are you gone gone
Down by the ocean it was so dismal
I was just standing with shock on my face
The hearse pulled away
The girl that had died it was you
You'll never return into my arms
'Cause you are gone gone
Never return into my arms
Ccause you are gone gone
Gone gone gone gone
"
4,Patti Smith,Free Money,"Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery
Scoop the pearls up from the sea
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need
Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad
I take that money, buy you things you never had
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby
Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream
And take you through the stratosphere
And check out the planets there and then take you down
Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia
Baby, then cool, cold fields of snow
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money
Free money, free money
Free money, free money
Free money, free money
Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery
Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me
Baby, I know our troubles will be gone
Oh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin' gone
If we dream, dream, dream for free
And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it
Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money
Free money, free money
Free money, free money
Free money, money
"
5,Patti Smith,People Have the Power,"I was dreaming in my dreaming
Of an aspect bright and fair
And my sleeping, it was broken
But my dream, it lingered near
In the form of shining valleys
Where the pure air recognized
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry

That the people have the power
To redeem the work of fools
Upon the meek the graces shower
It's decreed: the people rule

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

Vengeful aspect became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
And the armies ceased advancing
Because the people had their ear
And the shepherds and the soldiers
Lay beneath the stars
Exchanging visions and laying arms
To waste in the dust
In the form of shining valleys
Where the pure air recognized
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

Where there were deserts I saw fountains
Like cream the waters rise
And we strolled there together
With none to laugh or criticize
And the leopard and the lamb
Lay together truly bound
I was hoping in my hoping
To recall what I had found

I was dreaming in my dreaming
God knows a purer view
As I lay down to my sleeping
I commit my dream to you
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

The power to dream, to rule
To wrestle the world from fools
It's decreed: the people rule
It's decreed: the people rule
Listen. I believe everything we dream
Can come to pass through our union
We can turn the world around
We can turn the earth's revolution

We have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

The power to dream, to rule
To wrestle the world from fools
It's decreed: the people rule
It's decreed: the people rule
We have the power
We have the power
The people have the power

6,Patti Smith,Kimberly,"The wall is high, the black barn
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
And I know soon that the sky will split
And the planets will shift
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind
Little sister, the fates are calling on you
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
And the cause is you lookin' up at me
Oh baby, I remember when you were born
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
And I lit a match and the void went flash
And the sky split and the planets hit
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind
Little sister, the fates are calling on you
I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me
Your soul was like a network of spittle
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic
And I prayed as the lightning attacked
That something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack
The palm trees fall into the sea
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as you're safe, Kimberly
And I can gaze deep
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby
Into your starry eyes, oh
Oh, in your starry eyes, baby
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh
Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby
"
7,Patti Smith,Smells Like Teen Spirit,"Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored, myself assured
I know, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yeah

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yeah

And I forget just what it takes
And yet I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

The empty hand of innocence
Transfusing street of the sorrows
And children of the wood
Hounded, shredding all veils
And winding all sheets of the dead world droning
Overturning tables laden with silver sacrificial birds
Beating goat-skin drums
Advancing with hands outstretched
And we keep filling them with mercury nitrate, asbestos
Baby bombs blasting blue
Scavengers picking through the ashes
Children of the mills, children of the junkyards
Sleepy, illiterate, fuzzy little rats
Haunted, paint-sniffin'
Stoned out of their shaved heads
Forgotten, foraging, mystical children
Foul-mouthed, glassy eyed, hallucinating
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Ah, la la da, ah, la la da
Ah, la la la, ah, ma la ta
An albina, a mosquito
My libido, oh, my libido

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

8,Patti Smith,Break It Up,"Car stopped in a clearing
Ribbon of life, it was nearing
I saw the boy break out of his skin
My heart turned over and I crawled in
He cried, ""Break it up, oh I don't understand
Break it up, I can't comprehend
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you
Break it up, don't talk to me that way
I'm not listening""
Snow started falling
I could hear the angel calling
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings
The boy flew away and he started to sing
He sang, ""Break it up, oh, I don't understand
Break it up, I can't comprehend
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you
Break it up, don't look at me""
The sky was raging, the boy disappeared
I fell on my knees
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared
I cried, ""Take me please!""
Ice, it was shining
I could feel my heart, it was melting
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through
I cried, ""Break it up, oh, now I understand
Break it up, and I want to go
Break it up, oh please take me with you
Break it up, I can feel it breaking
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.""
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you
Break it up, now I'm gonna go
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming
Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up, break it up
Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up, break it on up
Break it up, break it on up, up, up
Break it, break it, break it, break it
Break it on up, break it up

9,Patti Smith,Elegie,"I just don't know what to do tonight
My head is aching as I drink and breathe
Memory falls like cream in my bones
Moving on my own
There must be something I can dream tonight
The air is filled with the moves of you
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah
Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance
And my skin emits a ray
But I think it's sad, it's much too bad
"
10,Patti Smith,My Generation,"People try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we g-g-g-get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I don't need their fucking shit (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I hope I die because of it (Talkin' 'bout my generation)

Why don't you all fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all s-s-say (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation, baby
My generation, baby
John Cale
Bababababababababa

My generation, baby
My generation, baby
I'm not trying to cause a b-big s-s-sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation, baby
My generation, baby

I'm so goddamn young
I'm so young
I'm so goddamn young
Oh, so young
I'm so goddamn young
"
11,Patti Smith,Piss Factory,"Sixteen and time to pay off
I get this job in a piss factory
Inspecting pipes
Forty hours
Thirty-six dollars a week
But it's a pay-check, Jack
So hot in here, hot like Sahara
You could faint from the heat
But these bitches are just too lame to understand
Too goddamned grateful to get this job
To know they're getting screwed up the ass
All these women
They got no teeth, or gum, or cranium
And the way they suck hot sausage
But me?
Well, I wasn't saying too much neither
I was more a school girl
Hard-working asshole
I figured I was speedo motorcycle
I had to earn my dough
Had to earn my dough
But no, you got to
You got to relate, babe
You got to find the rhythm within
Floor boss slides up to me and he says ""Hey sister
You're just moving too fast
You're screwing up the quota. You're doing your piece work too fast
Now you get off your Mustang, Sally,
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere.""
I laid back, I get my nerve up
I take a swig of Romilar
And walk up to hot shit Dot Hook
And I say
""Hey
Hey sister
It don't matter whether I do labor fast or slow
There's always more labor after.""
She's real Catholic, see
She fingers her cross
And she says
“There is one reason
There is one reason
You do it my way or I push your face in
We knee you in the John if you don't get off your Mustang, Sally
If you don't shake it up baby
Shake it up baby
Twist and shout”
Oh, would I could hear a radio here
James Brown singing 'I Lost Someone'
Or the Jesters
And the Paragons
And Georgie Woods, The Guy with the Goods
And Guided Missiles
But no
I got nothing
No diversion
No window
Nothing here but a porthole in the plaster
In the plaster
Where I look down, look at Sweet Theresa's convent
All those nurses, all those nuns
Scatting round with their blue hoods
Like cats in mourning.
Or to me they
You know, to me they look pretty damn free down there
Down there
Not having to press those smooth
Not having to smooth those hands against hot steel
Not having to worry about the in-speed
The dogma of in-speed labor
Or then, they’re pretty damn free down there
The way they smell
The way they smell
And here I got to be up here
Smelling Dot Hook's midwife sweat
I would rather smell the way boys smell
Oh, those schoolboys
Way their legs flap under the desk in the study hall
That odor rising
Roses and ammonia
And the way their dicks droop like lilacs
Or the way they smell that forbidden acrid smell
But no
I got to
I got to put clammy lady in my nostril
Her against the wheel
Me against the wheel
Oh, the in-speed, slow motion inspection
Is driving me insane
In steel next to Dot Hook
Oh, we may look the same
Shoulder to shoulder
Sweating 110 degrees
But I will never faint
I will never faint
They laugh and they expect me to faint
But I will never faint
I refuse to lose
I refuse to fall down
Because, you see
It's the monotony that's got to me
Every afternoon like the last one
Every afternoon like a re-run
Next to Dot Hook
And yes, we look the same
Both pumping steel
Both sweating
But you know she got nothing to hide
And I got something to hide here
Called desire.
I got something to hide here
Called desire
And I will get out of here
You know that fear potion is just about to come
In my nose is the taste of sugar
And I got nothing to hide here
Save desire
And I'm going to go
I'm going to get out of here
I'm going to get out of here
I'm going to get on that train
And I'm going to go on that train
And go to New York City
I'm going to be somebody
I'm getting
Going to get on that train
Go to New York City
I'm going to be so big
I'm going to be a big star
And I will never return
Never return
No, never return to burn at this piss factory
And I will travel light

12,Patti Smith,Hey Joe,"Honey, the way you play guitar
Makes me feel so
Makes me feel so
Masochistic
The way you go down low deep into the neck
And I would do anything
And I would do anything
And Patty Hearst
You standing there in front of the
Symbionese Liberation army flag with your legs spread
I was wondering were you gettin' it every night
From a black revolutionary man
And his women
Or were you really dead
And now that you're on the run what goes on in your mind
Your sisters they sit by the window
And all your mama does is sit and cry
And your daddy
Well you know what your daddy said Patty
You know what your daddy said Patty?
He said, he said, he said
Well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child
Now here she is with a gun in her hand...
Hey Joe, where're you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
I'm gonna go shoot my ol' lady
You know I found her messin' around town with another man
And you know that ain't cool, watch me
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down to the ground, you shot her
Yes I did, yes I did
Yes I did, I shot her, I shot her
I caught her messin' round with some other man
So I got my gun, I gave her the gun and I shot her, I shot her, shoot her one more time for me
Hey Joe, where you gonna, where you gonna run to?
Where you gonna run to, Joe
Where you gonna run to ?
Got a cover, I'm gonna go down south
I'm gonna go down south to Mexico
I'm going down, down, down to Mexico
Where a man can be free
No one's gonna put a noose around my neck
No one is gonna give me life, no
I'm goin' down to Mexico, I'm going down
You're not going to hear 'em stand there
And look at the stars as big as holes in the arms
And the sky is like a back drop, like a flag
And I was standin' there in front of that flag
With a car bomb Between my legs
You know, I felt so free of death beyond me
I felt so free, the F.B.I. is looking for me baby
But they'll never gonna find me, no
They can hunt me down like a dog
And I will stay on the run
And they can speculate what I'm feelin'
But daddy, daddy, you'll never know just what I was feelin'
But I'll tell you
I am no little pretty little rich girl
I am nobody's million dollar baby
I am nobody's patsy anymore
I'm nobody's million dollar baby
I'm nobody's patsy anymore

13,Patti Smith,Just Kids (Excerpt),"Yet you could feel a vibration in the air, a sense of hastening. It had started with the moon, inaccessible poem that it was. Now men had walked upon it, rubber treads on a pearl of the gods. Perhaps it was an awareness of time passing, the last summer of the decade. Sometimes I just wanted to raise my hands and stop. But stop what? Maybe just growing up.
The moon was on the cover of Life magazine, but the headlines of every newspaper were emblazoned with the brutal murders of Sharon Tate and her companions. The Manson murders didn’t gel with any film noir vision I had of crime, but it was the kind of news that sparked the imagination of the hotel inhabitants. Nearly every one was obsessed with Charles Manson. At first Robert went over every detail with Harry and Peggy, but I couldn’t bear talking about it. The last moments of Sharon Tate haunted me, imagining her
horror knowing that they were about to slaughter her unborn child. I retreated into my poems, scrawling in an orange composition book. Envisioning Brian Jones floating facedown in a swimming pool was as much tragedy as I could handle.
Robert had a fascination with human behavior, in what drove seemingly normal people to create mayhem. He kept up with the Manson news but his curiosity waned as Manson’s behavior grew more bizarre. When Matthew showed Robert a newspaper picture of Manson with an X carved on his forehead, Robert lifted the X, using the symbol in a drawing.“The X interests me, but not Manson,” he said to Matthew. “He’s insane. Insanity doesn’t interest me.”
A week or two later I waltzed into the El Quixote looking for Harry and Peggy. It was a bar-restaurant adjacent to the hotel, connected to the lobby by its own door, which made it feel like our bar, as it had been for decades. Dylan Thomas, Terry Southern, Eugene O’Neill, and Thomas Wolfe were among those who had raised one too many a glass there.
I was wearing a long rayon navy dress with white polka dots and a straw hat, my East of Eden outfit. At the table to my left, Janis Joplin was holding court with her band. To my far right were Grace Slick and the Jefferson Airplane, along with members of Country Joe and the Fish. At the last table facing the door was Jimi Hendrix, his head lowered, eating with his hat on, across from a blonde. There were musicians everywhere, sitting before tables laid with mounds of shrimp with green sauce, paella, pitchers of sangria, and bottles of tequila.
I stood there amazed, yet I didn’t feel like an intruder. The Chelsea was my home and the El Quixote my bar. There were no security guards, no pervasive sense of privilege. They were here for the Woodstock festival, but I was so afflicted by hotel oblivion that I wasn’t aware of the festival or what it meant. Grace Slick got up and brushed past me. She was wearing a floor-length tie-dyed dress and had dark violet eyes like Liz Taylor.
“Hello,” I said, noticing I was taller.
“Hello yourself,” she said.
When I went back upstairs I felt an inexplicable sense of kinship with these people, though I had no way to interpret my feeling of prescience. I could never have predicted that I would one day walk in their path. At that moment I was still a gangly twenty-two-year-old book clerk, struggling simultaneously with several unfinished poems.
On that night, too excited to sleep, infinite possibilities seemed to swirl above me. I stared up at the plaster ceiling as I had done as a child. It seemed to me that the vibrating patterns overhead were sliding into place.
The mandala of my life.
*
Mr. Bard returned the ransom. I unlocked our door and saw our portfolios leaning against the wall, the black with black ribbons, the red with gray ribbons. I untied them both and carefully looked at each drawing. I couldn’t be sure if Bard had even looked at the work. Certainly if he had, he didn’t see it with my eyes. Each drawing, each collage, reaffirmed my faith in our ability. The work was good. We deserved to be here.
Robert was frustrated that Bard didn’t accept our art as recompense. He was anxious about how we’d get by since that afternoon both his moving jobs were canceled. He lay on the bed with his white T-shirt, dungarees, and huaraches, looking very much like the day we met. But when he opened his eyes to look at me he did not smile. We were like fishermen throwing out our nets. The net was strong but often wereturned from ventures empty-handed. I figured we had to step up the action and find someone who would invest in Robert. Like Michelangelo, Robert just needed his own version of a pope. With so many influential people passing through the doors of the Chelsea, it was conceivable we could one day secure him a patron. Life at the Chelsea was an open market, everyone with something of himself to sell.
In the meantime we agreed to forget our cares for the night. We took a little money from our savings and walked to Forty-second Street. We stopped at a photo booth in Playland to take our pictures, a strip of four shots for a quarter. We got a hot dog and papaya drink at Benedict’s, then merged with the action. Boys on shore leave, prostitutes, runaways, abused tourists, and assorted victims of alien abduction. It was an urban boardwalk with Kino parlors, souvenir stands, Cuban diners, strip clubs, and late-night pawnshops. For fifty cents one could slip inside a theater draped in stained velvet and watch foreign films paired with soft porn.
We hit the used paperback stalls stocked with greasy pulp novels and pinup magazines. Robert was always on the lookout for collage material and I for obscure UFO tracts or detective novels with lurid covers. I scored a copy of the Ace double novel edition of Junkie by William Burroughs under his pseudonym William Lee, which I never resold. Robert found a few loose pages from a portfolio of sketches of Aryan boys in motorcycle caps by Tom of Finland.
For just a couple dollars we both got lucky. We headed home holding hands. For a moment I dropped back to watch him walk. His sailor’s gait always touched me. I knew one day I would stop and he would keep on going, but until then nothing could tear us apart.
The last weekend of the summer I went home to visit my parents. I walked to Port Authority feeling optimistic as I boarded the bus to South Jersey, looking forward to seeing my family and going to secondhand bookstores in Mullica Hill. We were all book lovers and I usually found something to resell in the city. I found a first edition of Doctor Martino signed by William Faulkner.
The atmosphere at my parents’ house was uncharacteristically bleak. My brother was about to enlist in the Navy, and my mother, though intensely patriotic, was distraught at the prospect of Todd being shipped off to Vietnam. My father was deeply disturbed by the My Lai massacre. “Man’s inhumanity to man,” he would say, quoting Robert Burns. I watched him plant a weeping willow in the backyard. It seemed to symbolize his sorrow for the direction our country had taken.
Later people would say the murder at the Altamont Stones concert in December marked the end of the idealism of the sixties. For me it punctuated the duality of the summer of 1969, Woodstock and the Manson cult, our masked ball of confusion.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

And
The steadfast

The callow mist
Dressed in scraps

15,Patti Smith,Rock N Roll Nigger,"Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore
Baby got big and baby get bigger
Baby get something. Baby get more
Baby, baby, baby was a rock-and-roll nigger
Oh, look around you, all around you
Riding on a copper wave
Do you like the world around you?
Are you ready to behave?
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me
Outside of society, that's where I want to be
(Lenny!)
Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore
You know she got big. Well, she's gonna get bigger
Baby got a hand; got a finger on the trigger
Baby, baby, baby is a rock-and-roll nigger
Outside of society, that's where I want to be
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me
(those who have suffered, understand suffering
And thereby extend their hand
The storm that brings harm
Also makes fertile
Blessed is the grass
And herb and the true thorn and light)
I was lost in a valley of pleasure
I was lost in the infinite sea
I was lost, and measure for measure
Love spewed from the heart of me
I was lost, and the cost
And the cost didn't matter to me
I was lost, and the cost
Was to be outside society
Jimi Hendrix was a nigger
Jesus Christ and Grandma, too
Jackson Pollock was a nigger
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger
Nigger, nigger, nigger
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me
Outside of society, if you're looking
That's where you'll find me
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me

16,Patti Smith,About a Boy,"Toward another he has gone
To breathe an air beyond his own
Toward a wisdom beyond the shelf
Toward a dream that dreams itself

About a boy beyond it all
About a boy beyond it all

From the forest from the foam
From the field that he had known
Toward a river twice as blessed
Toward the inn of happiness

About a boy beyond it all
About a boy beyond it all

From a chaos raging sweet
From the deep and dismal street
Toward another kind of peace
Toward the great emptiness
About a boy beyond it all
About a boy beyond it all

I stood among them I listened
I stood among them I listened not
I stood among them and I heard myself
Who I've loved better than you
So much so that I walked on
Into the face of God
Away from your world
And my sour stomach
Into the face of God, who said
Boy, I knew thee not, but boy
Now that I have you in my face
I embrace you. I welcome you
He was just a boy
Whirling in the snow
Just a little boy
Who would never growEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
17,Patti Smith,Summer Cannibals,"I was down in Georgia
Nothing was as real
As the street beneath a'my feet
Descending into air
The cauldron was a'bubbling
The flesh was lean
And the women moved forward
Like piranhas in a stream
They spread themselves before me
An offering so sweet
And they beckoned
Come on darling eat

Eat the summer cannibals
Eat eat eat
You eat the summer cannibals
Eat eat eat

They circled around me
Natives in a ring
And I saw their souls a'withering
Like snakes in chains
And they wrapped themselves around me
Ummm what a treat
And they rattled their tales
Hissing come on let's eat

I felt a rising in my throat
The girls a'saying  grace
And the air the vicious air
Pressed against my face
And it all got too damn much for me
Just got too damn rough
And I pushed away my plate
And said boys I've had enough
And I laid upon the table
Just another piece of meat
And I opened up my veins to them
And said come on eat


I was down in Georgia
Nothing was as real
As the street beneath a'my feet
Descending into hell
So eat eat eat

18,Patti Smith,Dream of Life,"I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through

Each way I turn the sense of you surrounds
In every step I take in all I do
Your thoughts your schemes
Captivate my dreams
Everlasting ever new

Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you

Deep in my heart
How the presence of you shines
In a light to last a whole life through
I recall the wonder of it all
Each dream of life I'll share with you


The hand above turns those leaves of love
All and all a timeless view
Each dream of life
Flung from paradise
Everlasting ever new

19,Patti Smith,Amerigo,"We were going to see the world
In this land we placed baptismal fonts
And an infinite number were baptized
And they called us Caribe
Which means men of great wisdom
Where are you going?
And are you going anywhere?
Where are we going?
Send me a letter
If you go at all
Ah the salvation of souls
But wisdom we had not
For these people had neither king nor lord
And bowed to no one
And they had lived in their own liberty
Where are you going?
And are you going anywhere?
Going in circles, going in circles anywhere
I saw and knew the inconstant shifting of fortune
And now I write to you
Words that have not been written
Words from the New World
Tracing the circles
Moving across my eyes
Lying on the ship
And gazing at the western sky
Tracing lazy circles in the sky
Hey--wake up!--wake up!
Where are you going?
And are you going anywhere?
Where are you going?
Send me a letter
If you go at all
It's such a delight to watch them dance
Free of sacrifice and romance
Free of all the things that we hold dear
Is that clear Your Excellency?
And I guess it's time to go but
I gotta send you just a few more lines
From the New World
Tracing the circles
Moving across my eyes
Lying on the ship
And gazing at the western sky
Tracing lazy circles in the sky
Tracing lazy circles in the sky
Tracing lazy circles
And the sky opened
And we laid down our armor
And we danced naked as they
Baptized in the rain

20,Patti Smith,Paths That Cross,"Speak to me
Speak to me heart

To bridge the clouds
Softly go
A way I wish to know
A way I wish to know
Oh you'll ride
Surely dance
In a ring
Backwards and forwards
Those who seek
Feel the glow
A glow we all will  know
A glow we all will  know
On that day
Filled with grace
And the light of communion
Steps we take
Steps we trace
Into the heart's reunion
Paths that cross
Will cross again
Paths that cross
Will cross again
Speak to me
Speak to me shadow
I spin from the wheel
Nothing at all
Save the need
The need to weave
A silk of souls
That whisper whisper
A silk of souls
That whispers to me
Speak to me heart
All things renew
Hearts will mend
Round the bend
Paths that cross
Cross again
Paths that cross
Will cross again
Rise up hold the reins
We'll meet again I don't know when
Hold tight bye bye
Paths that cross
Will cross again

21,Patti Smith,Gone Again,"Hey, now man's own kin
We commend into the wind
Grateful arms grateful limbs
Grateful soul he's gone again

I have a winter's tale
How vagrant hearts relent prevail
Sow their seed into the wind
Seize the sky and they're gone again
Fame is fleeting, God is nigh
We raise our arms to him on high
We shoot our flint into the sun
We bless our spoils and we're gone we're gone

Hey, now man's own kin
We commend into the wind
Grateful arms grateful limbs
Grateful heart gone again

Here a man, man's own kin
Turned his back and his own people shot him
And he fell on his knees
Before the burning plain
And he beheld fields of gold his land, his son
And he arose his blood aflame
Clouds pressed with hand prints stained
One last breath, the sky is high
The hungry earth, the empty vein
The ashes's rain, death's own bed
Man's own kin into the wind
One last breath, hole in life
Love knot tied, braid undone
A child born, the hollow horn
A warrior cried, a warrior died
One last breath, lick of flame
Spirit moaned, spirit shed
The heavens fed man's own kin
Grips the sky and he's gone again

Hey, now man's own kin
We lay down into the wind
Grateful arms grateful limbs
Grateful heart is gone again
Hey, now man's own kin
We lay down into the wind
Grateful heart grateful limbs
Grateful man, he's gone againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
22,Patti Smith,This Is the Girl,"This is the girl for whom all tears fall
This is the girl who was having a ball
Just a dark smear masking the eyes
Spirited away buried in sighs
This is the girl who crossed the line
This is the song about smothering vine
Twisted a laurel to crown her head
Laid as a wreath upon her bed
This is the girl
This the blood that turned into wine
This is the wine of the house it is said
This is the girl who yearned to be heard
So much for cradling a smoldering bird
This is the girl. This is the girl
This is the girl for whom all tears fall
This is the girl who was having a ball
This is the laurel to crown her head
This is the wine of the house it is said
This the blood that turned into wine
This is the wine of the house it is said
This is the girl who cried to be heard
So much for cradling a smothering bird

23,Patti Smith,So You Want To Be A Rock ‘N’ Roll Star,"So you want to be a rock & roll star
Well listen now to what i say
Get yourself an electric guitar
And take some time and learn how to play
And when hair's combed right
And your pants are tight
It's gonna be all right
With time you go downtown
To the agent man he won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
They're all waiting there
To sell plastic wares
And in a week or two if you make the charts
The girls will tear you apart
What you pay for these riches and fame
Well it's all a vicious game
You're a little insane
What you get is the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are
You're a rock & roll star
Na na na na na . 
Hey you. come here. get up
Ah, this is the era where everybody creates
Recognize my face?
They call me broken glass
That's because of the sound 
What you pay for all these riches and fame
Well it's all a vicious game
You're a little insane
Well you're a little insane
Oh a little insane
'cause the thing that you gain
Is the public acclaim

24,Patti Smith,Constantine’s Dream,"In Arezzo I dreamed a dream
Of St. Francis who kneeled and prayed
For the birds and the beasts and all human kind
All through the night I felt drawn in by him
And I heard him call
Like a distant hymn
I retreated from the silence of my room
Stepping down the ancient stones washed with dawn
And entered the basilica that bore his name
Seeing his effigy I bowed my head
And my racing heart I gave to him
I kneeled and prayed
And sleep that I could not find in the night
I found through him
I saw before me the world of his world
The bright fields, the birds in abundance
All of nature of which he sang
Singing of him
All the beauty that surrounded him as he walked
His nature that was nature itself
And I heard him--I heard him speak
And the birds sang sweetly
And the wolves licked his feet
But I could not give myself to him
I felt another call from the basilica itself
The call of art--the call of man
And the beauty of the material drew me away
And I awoke, and beheld upon the wall
The dream of Constantine
The handiwork of Piero della Francesca
Who had stood where I stood
And with his brush stroked the legend of the True Cross
And he envisioned Constantine advancing to greet the enemy
But as he was passing the river
An unaccustomed fear gripped his bowels
An anticipation so overwhelming that it manifested in waves
All thru the night a dream drew toward him
As an advancing Crusade
He slept in his tent on the battlefield
While his men stood guard
And an angel awoke him
Constantine within his dream awoke
And his men saw a light pass over the face of the King
The troubled King
And the angel came and showed to him
The sign of the true cross in heaven
And upon it was written
In this sign shall thou conquer
In the distance the tents of his army were lit by moonlight
But another kind of radiance lit the face of Constantine
And in the morning light
The artist, seeing his work was done
Saw it was good
In this sign shall thou conquer
He let his brush drop and passed into a sleep of his own
And he dreamed of Constantine carrying him into battle in his right hand
An immaculate undefiled and single white Cross
Piero della Francesca, as his brush stroked the wall
Was filled with the torpor
And fell into a dream of his own
From the geometry of his heart he mapped it out
He saw the King rise, fitted with armor
Set upon a white horse
An immaculate cross in his right hand
He advanced toward the enemy
And the symmetry, the perfection of his mathematics
Caused the scattering of the enemy
Agitated, broken, they fled
And Piero dela Francesca, waking, cried out
All is art--all is future!
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure
With a brush and an eye full of light
But as he advanced in age
The light was shorn from his eyes
And blinded, he layed upon his bed
On an October morning, 1492, and whispered
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure
And a world away--a world away
On three great ships
Adventure itself as if to answer
Pulling into the New World
And as far as his eyes could see
No longer blind
All of nature, unspoiled--beautiful--beautiful
And such a manner that would have lifted
The heart of St. Francis
Into the realm of universal love
Columbus set foot on the New World
And witnessed beauty unspoiled
All of the delights given by God
As if in Eden itself--as if Eden had opened up her heart to him
And opened her dress
And all of her fruit gave to him
And Columbus so overwhelmed
Fell into a sleep of his own
All the world in his sleep
All of the beauty--all of the beauty entwined with the future
The twenty-first century
Advancing like the angel
Advancing like the angel that had come
To Constantine
Constantine in his dream
Oh this is your cross to bear
Oh Lord Oh Lord let me deliver
Hallowed adventure to all mankind
In the future
Oh art cried the painter
Oh art--Oh art--cried the angel
Art the great material gift of man
Art that hath denied
The humble pleas of St. Francis
Oh thou Artist
All shall crumble
Into dust
Oh thou navigator
The terrible end of man
This is your gift to mankind
This is your cross to bear
And Columbus
Saw all of nature aflame
The apocalyptic night
And the dream
Of the troubled king
Dissolved into lightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Let's close our eyes and call the deep
Slumbering land that just begins
When day is done and little dreamers spin
First take my hand then let it go
Little blue boy you're on your own
Little blue wings as those feet fly
Little blue shoes that walk across the sky

May your path be your own
But I'm with you
And each day you'll grow
He'll be there too
And someday you'll go
We'll follow you
As you go, as you go

Little blue star that offers light
Little blue bird that offers flight
Little blue path where those feet fall

Folding her wings will you remember me

28,Patti Smith,Changing of the Guards,"Sixteen years
Sixteen banners united over the field
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men, desperate women divided
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves
Fortune calls
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On midsummer's eve near the tower
The cold-blooded moon
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid
They shaved her head
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
I stumbled to my feet
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you
The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times
She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks
Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
Peace will come
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of SwordsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
29,Patti Smith,When Doves Cry,"Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Come on, darling
Can you picture this?
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold ?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch, if you will, my belly
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (a world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (ya know he's 2 bold)
Maybe I'm just like my mother (maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (she's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why do we scream at each other)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
When doves cry (doves cry, doves cry, doves cry)
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

30,Patti Smith,My Blakean Year,"In my Blakean year
I was so disposed
Toward a mission yet unclear
Advancing pole by pole
Fortune breathed into my ear
Mouthed a simple ode
One road is paved in gold
One road is just a road
In my Blakean year
Such a woeful schism
The pain of our existence
Was not as I envisioned
Boots that trudged from track to track
Worn down to the sole
One road is paved in gold
One road is just a road
Boots that tramped from track to track
Worn down to the sole
One road was paved in gold
One road was just a road
In my Blakean year
Temptation but a hiss
Just a shallow spear
Robed in cowardice
Brace yourself for bitter flack
For a life sublime
A labyrinth of riches
Never shall unwind
The threads that bind the pilgrim's sack
Are stitched into the Blakean back
So throw off your stupid cloak
Embrace all that you fear
For joy shall conquer all despair
In my Blakean year
So throw off your stupid cloak
Embrace all that you fear
For joy shall conquer all despair
In my Blakean yearEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
31,Patti Smith,Wild Leaves,"Wild leaves are falling
Falling to the ground
Every leaf a moment
A light upon the crown
That we'll all be wearing
In a time unbound

And wild leaves are falling
Falling to the ground

Every word that's spoken
Every word decreed
Every spell that's broken
Every golden deed
All the parts we're playing
Binding as the reed

And wild leaves are falling
Wild wild leaves

The spirits that are mentioned
The myths that have been shorn
Everything we've been through
And the colors worn
Every chasn entered
Every story wound
And wild leaves are falling
Falling to the ground

As the campfire's burning
As the fire ignites
All the moments turning
In the stormy bright
Well enough the churning
Well enough believe
The coming and the going
Wild wild leavesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
32,Patti Smith,Everybody hurts,"When your day is long and the night
When the night is yours alone
When you think you've had enough of this life
Well hang on
Don't let yourself go 'cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night hold on
(Hold on)
(Hold on)
If you feel like letting go
(Hold on)
(Hold on)
If you're sure you've had too much of this life hang on
'Cause everybody hurts sometimes
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts
Don't blow your hands
Oh
No
Don't blow your hands if you feel like you're alone
No
No
No
You're not alone
If you're on your own in this life and the days and nights are long
If you're sure you've had too much of this life to hang on
Yeah
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on

34,Patti Smith,After the Gold Rush,"Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Sayin something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
35,Patti Smith,Seneca,"(The Wing Child)
O chariot of insect
O crown of wind
Two royal leopards
Run with him
On a golden lead
Of tapered vine
O the blood sky
O the blood sky
Wine of a God
Running wild
O golden seed
Who made the
Winged child
(Seneca)
Run, run my little one
Run out to sea
Run, run my little one
What do you seek?
The canvas is high
The scheme of a life
Written in the wind
The pen, the knife
Run my little one
Breathe a hymn
Breathe my little one
A hymn to Him
To Him
The master is calling, calling
The canvas is high
The scheme of a life
Written in the wind
The pen, the knife
Run, run out to sea
Run my little one
What do you seek?
If you were his eyes
If you were his dreams
The whole of the sky
Could not contain you
So run, run, run out to sea
Run, run my little one
Breathe a hymn
For Him
For theeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
36,Patti Smith,Looking for You (I Was),"In the medieval night
Twas love's design
And the sky was open
Like a valentine
All the lacy lights
Where wishes fall
And like Shakespeare's child
I wished on them all
Ahh to be your destiny
Was all that I pursued
I could see the sights
From the lofty heights
But my heart obscured the view

I was looking for you
Looking for you
What could I do
I was looking for you

Along the black river
The ambassador jewels
And you were reflected
In all that I saw
In the towers of gold
In the wheel and wing
Gripping my senses
Like an ancient clam
Many is the time I knelt in the light
Appealing to all that I know
Guide my eyes and steps
That I may find love true

Come on darlin'
All that hearts desire
Was written before us
In the medieval fire
It was love's design
In the glittering star
Like Shakespeare's child
To be where you are
From the Portobello Road
To the Port of Marseilles
Where the dervish turns
Where the wild goats play
Looking for you
I wasEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
37,Patti Smith,Glitter in Their Eyes,"It's been a while since I've seen your face
It's been a while since I've walked this place
I see the monkeys riding on their bikes
Racing through the impossible night
You say you're feeling like a new tree
Man, they'll cut you from limb to limb
Pick your pocket with delight
Shake it to the right
Shake it in the light
Chorus:
Oh can't you see the glitter
The glitter in their eyes
Oh can't you see the glitter
The glitter in their eyes
Genius stalking in new shoes
Have you got WTO blues
Dust of diamonds
Making you sneeze
Kids on rollers ready for
Running through the junkyards
Breezing through the halls
Racing through the malls
Walking through the walls
They'll strip your mind
Just for fun
Quoth the raven
Yum yum yum
Chorus
Children, children everywhere
Selling souls for souvenirs
They've been sold out like as not
Just for chunks of Ankgor Vat
Chorus 2x
They'll trade you up
Trade you down
Your body a commodity
Our sacred stage
Has been defaced
Replaced to grace
The marketplace
Dow is jonesing at the bit
42nd Disney Street
Ragged hearts unraveling
Look out kids
The gleam the gleam
All that glitters
Is not all that glitters
Is not all that glittersEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
38,Patti Smith,April Fool,"Come       be my April fool
Come     you're the only one
Come     on your rusted bike
Come     we'll break all the rules
We'll ride like writers ride
Neither rich nor broke
We'll race through alleyways
In our tattered cloaks so
Come     be my April fool
Come     we'll break all the rules
We'll burn all of our poems
Add to God's debris
We'll pray to all of our saints
Icons of mystery
We'll tramp through the mire
When our souls feel dead
With laughter we'll inspire
Then back to life again
Come     you're the only one
Come     be my April fool
Come     Come
Be my April fool
We'll break all the rulesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

40,Patti Smith,Peaceable Kingdom,"Yesterday I saw you standing there
With your hand against the pane
Looking out the window at the rain
And I wanted to tell you
That your tears were not in vain
But I guess we both knew
We'd never be the same
Never be the same
Why must we hide all these feelings inside?
Lions and lambs shall abide
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough
To build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom
Back again
Build it back again
Why must we hide all these feelings inside?
Lions and lambs shall abide
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough
To build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom
Back again
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough
To build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom
Build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom

41,Patti Smith,Boy Cried Wolf,"Oh the story's told been told retold
From the sacred scriptures to the tabloids
All the fuss and fight none above a whisper
The soul of gold the belly of a boy
Well they drew him from the forest
Like they draw blood
Tied him to a tree like St. Sebastian
And he turned his head and let the arrows fly
Through the trees, the trees
The ornamental leaves
Boy cried wolf
Wolf don't come
Wolf within
Boy cried wolf
In the ancient mold they're dancing down
Calling to the moon but it don't answer
And they fell on their knees
And passed the bowl around
And the blood the blood the sacramental blood
Boy cried wolf
Wolf don't come
Wolf within
Boy cried wolf
I am the body I am the stream
I am the wake of everything
They bring me flowers that are myself
Garlands of blood that are myself
Slain the lamb that is himself
Torn reborn the cries of our dismay
Are nothing to the wind but whose to mind
Kings are lifted up and kings are thrown
Lost received retrieved
The human tide
Innocence had its day
Innocence had its day
Innocence innocenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
42,Patti Smith,Until The End Of The World,"Haven't seen you in quite a while
I was down the hold, just passing time
Last time we met was a low-lit room
We were as close together as bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time
Except you
You were talking about the end of the world
I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world
In my dream I was drowning my sorrows
But my sorrows they learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
In waves of regret, waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait until the end of the world

43,Patti Smith,1959,"Listen to my story
Got two tales to tell
One of fallen glory
One of vanity
The world's roof was raging
We were looking fine
Cause we built that thing
And it grew wings
In 1959
Wisdom was a teapot, pouring from above
Desolation angels served it up with love
Igniting life every form of light
Moved by bold design
Slid in that thing
And it grew wings
In 1959
It was blue and shining in the sun
Braced, native
Speeding the American plain
Into freedom freedom freedom
China was a tempest
And madness overflowed
The lama was a young man
And watched his world in flames
Taking glory down
By the edge of clouds
It was a crying shame
Another lost horizon
Tibet the fallen star
Wisdom and compassion crushed
In the land of Shangri-la
But in the land of the Impala honey
Well we were looking fine
Cause we built that thing and it grew wings in 1959
Cause we built that thing and it grew wings in 1959
Cause we built that thing and it grew wings in 1959
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times in 1959

44,Patti Smith,Tarkovsky (The Second Stop Is Jupiter),"The eternal sun runs to the mother
She smoothes his brow and bids him
Drink from her well of hammered mist
Come along sweet lad, fog rises from the ground
The falling soot is just the dust of a shivering gem
The black moon shines on a lake
White as a hand in the dark
She lifts the lamp to see his face
The silver ladle of his throat
The boy the beast and the butterfly
The sea is a morgue, the needle and the gun
These things float in blood that has no name
The telegraph poles are crosses on the line
Rusted pins not enough saviors to hang
She blesses the road the robe and the road and the noose of vine
And waits beneath the triangle
Formed by Mercury, an evening star
The fifth planet with its blistering sore
And the soaring eagle above and to the west
The boy the beast and the butterfly
She walks across a bridge of magpies
Her hollow tongue fills the brightness
With water and in the wink of an eye
One planet with a glittering womb
One white crow one diamond head
Big as a world big as a world
The boy the beast the butterfly
Quivering above the sore the blistering sore of the fifth planet
Wait, stop! Don't forget, don't forget how I played with you
How I kissed away your tears--don't forget
The white mouth of the son smiles
On his beautiful tongue the seed of flightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
45,Patti Smith,Capitol Letter,"Rebellion has a heart
Breaking as the dawn
Bursting into song

In her soft boots
Racing through the flames
Racing through the flames
She's the silent one
In her soft boots
Trawling her bow
And her only truth
Rebellion is an arrow
Wired to the sun
Igniting everyone
Igniting everyone
Bird in the hand
Another role to play
Mocking as the jay

Racing through the flames
Racing through the flames

46,Patti Smith,White Rabbit,"One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall
And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice
When she was just small
When men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know
When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's ""off with her head!""
Remember what the dormouse said:
""Feed your head
Feed your head
Feed your head""
You're getting smallerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
47,Patti Smith,Banga,"Loyalty rests in the heart of a dog
Don't set all your eggs on the back of a frog
You can lick it twice but it won't lick you
And salvating salvation gone so long so
Loyalty lives and we don't know why
And the paw is pressed against the nerve of the sky
You can leave him behind but he won't leave you
And the road to Heaven is true--true blue
Banga / Say--Banga
Loyalty lives and we don't know why
And his paws are pressed to the spine of the sky
You can leave him twice, but he won't leave you
And the way to Heaven is true--true blue

Loneliness lifts when you open the night
Pilate awaits, as Jesus Christ
Forget him not--won't forget about you
The way to Heaven is blue--boo hoo

Loyalty shifts if you carry a load
Ah, don't shit it out in a golden commode
You can kick him twice--it'll erode
Night is a mongrel--believe or explode
On the lonely night on a golden rode
Night is a mongrel--believe or explodeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
48,Patti Smith,Grateful,"Ours is just another skin
That simply slips away
You can rise above it
It will shed easily
It all will come out fine
I've learned it line by line
One common wire
One silver thread
All that you desire
Rolls on ahead
Like a ship in a bottle
Held up to the sun
Sails ain't going nowhere
You can count every one
Until it crashes unto the earth
And simply slips away
You can hide in the open
Or just disappear
Ours is just a craving
And a twist of the wrist
Will undo the stopper
With abrupt tenderness
Die little sparrow
And awake
Singing
It all will come out fine
I've learned it line by line
One common wire
One silver thread
All that you desire
Rolls on aheadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
49,Patti Smith,Are You Experienced?,"If you can just get your mind together
Then come on across to me
We'll hold hands and then we'll watch the sun rise
From the bottom of the sea
Are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
Well, I know, I know you'll probably scream and cry
That your little world won't let you go
But who in your measly little world are trying to prove
That you're made out of gold and -a can't be sold
So, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
Ah, let me prove it to you
Hurray, I awake from yesterday
Alive but the war is here to stay
So my darling and me
Decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be reborn
Away from lands so battred and torn
Forever
So, you see it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick-tube shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screamin' pain
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand
And the sea is straight ahead
Straight ahead
Straight ahead
Trumpets and violins, I hear in the distance
I think they're calling our names
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will, you will
If you just take hold of my hand
Are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
Not necessarily stoned
But beautifulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Turn where you stood

Would it be good
Would u remember
So turn the little key

Turn the little key
The cock is crowing
The rum is flowing
A mermaid burns to sea
Beyond the sea
I long to see

If there's a page for me

51,Patti Smith,Foreword (Just Kids),"I was asleep when he died. I had called the hospital to say one more good night, but he had gone under, beneath layers of morphine. I held the receiver and listened to his labored breathing through the phone, knowing I would never hear him again.
Later I quietly straightened my things, my notebook and fountain pen. The cobalt inkwell that had been his. My Persian cup, my purple heart, a tray of baby teeth. I slowly ascended the stairs, counting them, fourteen of them, one after another. I drew the blanket over the baby in her crib, kissed my son as he slept, then lay down beside my husband and said my prayers. He is still alive, I remember whispering. Then I slept.
I awoke early, and as I descended the stairs I knew that he was dead. All was still save the sound of the television that had been left on in the night. An arts channel was on. An opera was playing. I was drawn to the screen as Tosca declared, with power and sorrow, her passion for the painter Cavaradossi. It was a cold March morning and I put on my sweater.
I raised the blinds and brightness entered the study. I smoothed the heavy linen draping my chair and chose a book of paintings by Odilon Redon, opening it to the image of the head of a woman floating in a small sea. Les yeux clos. A universe not yet scored contained beneath the pale lids. The phone rang and I rose to answer.
It was Robert’s youngest brother, Edward. He told me that he had given Robert one last kiss for me, as he had promised. I stood motionless, frozen; then slowly, as in a dream, returned to my chair. At that moment, Tosca began the great aria “Vissi d’arte.” I have lived for love, I have lived for Art. I closed my eyes and folded my hands. Providence determined how I would say goodbye.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
52,Patti Smith,As the Night Goes By,"Darlin' come under cover
Another night to discover
Let's slip where senses gather
Let's drift between the sea and sky
As the night goes by
Sands shift
Orchids so strange
In the moonlight
Brushing our faces
Places where love blooms
And dies
While the night goes by
Oh, and the spirits call
Sun upon your shadows fall
Tracing every breath we draw
Come into my dreams
Darlin' let's go where the night goes
Let's drift where senses gather
Let's make this night last forever
Into my dreams
Darlin' let's go
Where the night goes
Time slips
Oh darlin' how it flies
When the night goes by
All through the night
Sirens call
Come to me
I'll come to you
As the night softly
Goes by bye

Moon on our shoulder
Daybreak
Another one older
Darlin' heavenly blue
Glories fade into view
Let's go
Under the stars

Under the moonlight

Dusk just a whisper
Make this night
Last forever

Down the drain of your humankind
The time has arrived
You be waiting here
As I was in a snow white shroud
Waiting underground
There by the ridge, be a gathering
Beneath the pilgrim moon
There we shall await, the beat
Of your feet, hammering the earth
Where the great ones tremble
In their snow white shrouds
Waiting underground
If you seek the kingdom, come along
Waiting by the ridge, there'll be a gathering
Beneath the pilgrim moon
Where the river thunders
Where we shall await, the beat
Of your feet, hammering the earth
And as the earth resounds
Where the great ones tremble
And your humankind becomes as one
Then we will arise in our snow white shrouds
Then we will be as one
But until that day we will just await
In our snow white shrouds
Waiting underground

To tend to me Now's the time
To turn the view Now that I have you
And I'll rise Every little morn'
To tend to thee When you rise
Open up your eyes You will see
There I'll be Waiting by the door
Come to me Take my hand
Look into your heart There I'll be
Now's the time To turn the view
Now that I have you
Now's the time To turn the view
Now that I have you
Roses growing by my door Climbing up the vine
All the thorns and pain obscured Roses shall divine
Where we feel no pain And the love inside
Where roses climb Roses shall divine
Roses shall divine Holy mother
Mother of gold Mother with stories
Told and retold She felt our tears
Heard our sighs And turned to gold
Before our eyes She rose into the light
She rose into the light She rose into the lightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
57,Patti Smith,Radio Ethiopia/Abyssinia,"Oh I'll send you a telegram
Oh I have some information for you
Oh I'll send you a telegram
Send it deep in the heart of you
Deep in the heart of your brain is a lever
Deep in the heart of your brain is a switch
Deep in the heart of your flesh you are clever
Oh you met your match in a bitch
There will be no famine in my existence
I merge with people of the hills
People of Ethiopia
Your opiate is the air that you breathe
All those mint bushes around you
Are the perfect thing for your system
Aww clean clean it out
You must rid yourself from these these animal fixations
You must release yourself
From the thickening blackmail of elephantiasis
You must divide the wheat from the rats
You must turn around and look oh God
When I see Brancusi
His eyes searching out the infinite
Abstract spaces in the radio
Rude hands of sculptor
Now gripped around the neck of a Duo-Sonic
I swear on your eyes no pretty words will sway meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
58,Patti Smith,Maria,"At the edge of the world
Where you were no one
Yet you were the girl
The only one
At the edge of the world
In the desert heat
One shivering star
Sweet indiscreet
I knew you
When we were young
I knew you
Now you're gone
In a little Narcissus pool
Drawn by its spell
We saw ourselves
Raw excitable
I knew you
When we were young
I knew you
Now you're gone
We didn't know
The precariousness of our young powers
All the emptiness
Wild wild hair
Sad sad eyes
White shirt / black tie
You were mine
You grabbed the ring
Of the carousel
Tangoing
From Heaven
To Hell
I knew youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
59,Patti Smith,Everybody Wants to Rule the World,"Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never need it
One headline why believe it ?
Everybody wants to rule the world
All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the worldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
60,Patti Smith,Nine,"Night a nine of diamonds
A woman lay and cries
At the Sister of Mercy
On a Sabbath day
Night a nine of diamonds
As revelers commence
To shiver as she bore
In a babe, a radiance
Brave in constant motion
Wherein perfection brews
Darkness as his brother
Mischief as his moon
Summoning beneath
With his gypsy moves
Yearning as the foal
Shy and beautiful
Every card he drew
Had a different face
Lingering and lost
Unholy holy ghosts
I tend to play them all
He spoke with confidence
Another kind of strange
To shift in loneliness
He sought not for himself
The empire he would find
Save the golden womb
He enters in his mind
We will die a little
The rogues whistling
Nine blue-eyed sailors
Tip their caps to him
As he passes through them
More vagabond than king
With diamonds on his sleeves
Like a harlequinEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
61,Patti Smith,Soul Kitchen,"Well, the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now
I'd really like to stay here all night
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
Street lights share their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Well the clock says it's time to close now
I know I have to go now
I really want to stay here
All night, all night, all nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
62,Patti Smith,Memorial Song (Live),"Little emerald bird
Wants to fly away
If I cup my hand
Could I make him stay
Little emerald soul
Little emerald eye
Little emerald soul
Must you say good-bye
All the things that we pursue
All that we dream are composed
As nature knew in a feather green
Little emerald bird
As you light afar it is true I heard
God is where you are little emerald soul
Little emerald eye little emerald bird
We must say good-byeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
63,Patti Smith,Don’t Say Nothing,"Lower the thing the skin of a cat
Skin it to the left just laying there
No other thing is luck like that
And you set it said it said nothing
Went to the party very discouraged
I watched the litter pile like a wall
I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it
It was ladened with all kinds of shit
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing
I turned my back walked away
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner
I was listening they were saying this and saying that
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered
Nothing good was coming I just stood there
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing
I walked the floor then I looked away
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing
How long how long will we make do
Maybe it's time to break on through
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card
Well I'm gonna do something
Oh my brain I got to complain
You can refrain but I'm gonna do something
How long how long will we make do
Maybe it's time to break on through
Out in the desert I saw that old cat skinned
I saw it floating in the river
I saw and no one seemed to mind
They sat there they sat there watching the sun
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun
Spread its wings and fly away
And in the mountains a cry echoes
Don't say nothing
Don't say nothing no
Don't say nothing noEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
64,Patti Smith,Helpless,"There is a town in north ontario
With dream comfort memory to spare
And in my mind I still need a place to go
All my changes were there
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Baby, sing with me somehow
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helplessEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
65,Patti Smith,Lo and Beholden,"I was alone and content in my world
Dancing on air
You sent to me a message that said
I like your style
Will you come to the temple tonight
And dance for me there
I pledge to you all that you wish
The moon and the stars
Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden
Oh I'm beholden to you
In the palace there was wild reverie
And the look in your eyes
As I dropped veil after veil
Was drunken desire
The dove calls and God notes it all
The naked truth
Here is my veil the seventh and last
It will cost you
Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden
Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden
Oh I'm beholden to you
The royal word has passed
The prophet's head is all I ask
For beauty and the naked truth
It will cost you
Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden
Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden
Oh I'm beholden to youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
66,Patti Smith,Blue Poles,"Mother as I write the sun dissolves
Blood life streaming cross my hand
And these words, these words
Hope dashed immortal hope
Hope streaking the canvas sky
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
We joined the long caravan
Hungry dreaming going west
Just for work just to get a job
And we never got lucky
We just forged on
And the dust the endless dust
Like a plague it covered everything
Hal fell with the fever
And mother I did what I could
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
We prayed we prayed for rain
I never wanted to see the sun again
All my dresses you made hand
We left behind on the road
Hal died in my arms
We buried him by the river
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
"
67,Patti Smith,Up There Down There,"Up there
There's a ball of fire
Some call it the spirit
Some call it the sun
Its energies are not for hire
It serves man it serves everyone

Down there where Jonah wails
In the healing water
In the ready depths
Twisting like silver swans
No line of death no boundaries
Up there the eye is hollow the eye is winking
The winds ablaze angels howling
The sphinx awakens
But what can she say
You'd be amazed
Down there
Your days are numbered
Nothing to fear
There will be trumpets
There will be silence
In the end the end
Will be here just here
Ahh the borders of heaven
Are zipped up tight tonight
The abstract streets
The lights like some switched-on Mondrian
Cats like us are obsolete
Hey Man don't breath on my feet
Thieves, poets we're inside out
And everybody's a soldier
Angels howl at those abstract lights
And the borders of heaven
Are zipped up tight tonight

The air we breathe
The flame of wisdom
The earth we grind
The beckoning sea
It's no mystery
Not sentimental
Ahh the equation
It's all elemental
The world is restless
Heaven in flux
Angels appears
From the bright storm
Out of the shadows
Up there, down there
But what can we say
Man's been forewarned

All communion is not holy
Even those that fail
They can prophet that fall
It's all for man
It's for everyone
It's up there, down there
Everywhere
Time for communion
Talking communionEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
68,Patti Smith,China Bird,"One fine day these words I pray
Will breathe a truth
Within yourself upon a shelf
A life anew
So many roads
It's hard to know what to do
All your dreams
All it seems
Is as you choose
For destiny my china bird
Is calling for you
The world turns
The flame burns
Bright and true
Near and far
Where you are
Guiding you china bird
The open skies
Are yearning for you
If they say it's not that way
Hold your view
With my love fly above
A light anew
Oh spread your wings
The open sky
Is calling to you china bird
My heart is yearning for you
If you fly away
I'll be waiting come what may
All my love a fragile ray
For you for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
69,Patti Smith,My Madrigal,"We waltzed beneath motionless skies
All heaven's glory turned in your eyes
We expressed such sweet vows
Oh, 'til death do us part
Oh, 'til death do us part
We waltzed beneath God's point of view
Knowing no ending to our rendezvous
We expressed such sweet vows
Oh, 'til death do us part
Oh, 'til death do us part
We waltzed beneath motionless skies
All heaven's glory turned in your eyes
You pledged me your heart
'Til death do us part
You pledged me your heart
Oh, 'til death do us part

70,Patti Smith,Going Under,"Sun is rising on the water
Light is dancing again
Let's go under where the sun beams
Let's go under my friend
Are we sleeping
Are we dreaming
Are we dancing again
Is it heaven crack it open
And we'll slide down its stream
We can hold on (I'm sure)
To the sea's foaming mane
It will serve us
We'll surface
And we'll plunge back again
Sun is rising on the water
Light is dancing like a flame
There's no burning where the sun beams
Oh it's such a lovely game
Does the sea dream (I'm sure)
We are here, we attend
We are bells on the shore
As the tolling suspends
Who will decide the shape of things
The shift of being
Who will perceive when life is new
Shall we divide and become another
Who is due for gift upon gift
Who will decide
Shall we swim over and over
The curve of a wing
Its destination ever hanging
Sun is rising on the water
Light is dancing like a flame
Let's go waltzing on the water
Let's go under again
Let's go under

71,Patti Smith,Path That Cross,"Speak to me
Speak to me heart
I feel a needing
To bridge the clouds
Softly go
A way I wish to know to know
Oh you'll tide
Surely dance in a ring
Backward and forwards
Those who seek
Feel the glow
A glow we all will know
On that day filled with grace
And the heart's communion
Steps we take steps we trace
Into the light of reunion

Paths that cross
Will cross again
Paths that cross
Will cross again

Speak to me
Speak to me shadow
I spin from the wheel
Nothing at all save the need
The need to weave
A silk of souls
That whisper whisper
A silk of souls
That whispers to me
Speak to me heart
All things renew
Hearts will mend
'Round the bend
Paths that cross
Cross again
Paths that cross
Will cross again

Rise up hold the reins
We'll meet again
I don't when
Hold tight bye bye

Paths that cross
Will cross again
Paths that cross
Will cross againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

73,Patti Smith,Strange Messengers,"I looked upon the book of life
Tracing the lines of face after face
Looking down at their naked feet
Bound in chains bound in chains
Chains of leather chains of gold
We knew it was wrong but we looked away
And paraded them down the colonial streets
And that's how they became enslaved
They came across on the great ships
Mothers separated from their babes
Husbands stood on the auction block
Bound in chains bound in chains
Chains of leather chains of gold
Men knew it was wrong but they looked away
And led them to toil in fields of white
As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape
Oh the people I hear them calling
Am I not a man and a brother
Am I not a woman and a sister
History sends us such strange messengers
They come down through time
To embrace to enrage
And in their arms even stranger fruit
And they swing from the trees
With their vision in flames
Ropes of leather ropes of gold
Men knew it was wrong but they looked away
Messengers swinging from twisted rope
As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape
Oh the people I hear them calling
Am I not a man and a brother
Am I not a woman and a siste

74,Patti Smith,Farewell Reel,"It's been a hard time
And when it rains
It rains on me
The sky just opens
And when it rains
It pours

I walk alone
Assaulted it seems
By tears of heaven
And darling I can't help
Thinking those tears are yours
Our wild love came from above
And wilder still
Is the wind that howls
Like a voice that knows it's gone
Cause darling you died
And well I cried
But I'll get by
Salute our love
And send you a smile
And move on
So darling farewell
All will be well
And then all will be fine
The children will rise
Strong and happy be sure
Cause your love flows
And the corn still grows
And God only knows
We're only given
As much as the heart can endure
But I don't know why
But when it rains
It rains on me
The sky just opens
And when it rains
It pours

But I look up
And a rainbow appears
Like a smile from heaven
And darling I can't
Help thinking that smile
Is yoursEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
75,Patti Smith,Last Call,"In a mansion high the young man stood
Ready to join his companions good
Outside the scent of magnolia blossoms
Down streets of gold the children were racing
Just another wandering soul
Adrift among the stars
Just another human heart
Led, led away
He put his shoes on and he laid down
Outside the clouds were swiftly gathering
He drained his cup and he stirred the mixture
And he closed his eyes as his conscience whispered
Just another wandering soul
Adrift among the stars
Just another human heart
Led, led away
Misgivings unspoken he joined his companions
His face covered over in a mansion high
Outside the children gazed in wonder
At the quickening sky then slowly disbanded
Thirty-nine wandering souls
Adrift among the stars
Thirty-nine human hearts
Led, led away
His burning skin cooled by angels
Swallowing sorrows excretion
It's all excretion
Felled by his hand or the mind of another man
Who makes the decisions
Lends no provisions for mere eternal rides
Learning of course every alien force
Even Christ yearns to be
To possess the skin
And bone the blood of man
Who tends the flock who breaks the bread
Who makes his own choices
Won't listen to voices
Accept no false teachers
False preachers, good deeders
With their hands out stretched
To be filled with your money
Your mind, your heart, your imagination
Sympathy, empathy
Acknowledge all man as fellow creation
But don't follow him
Don't be led awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
76,Patti Smith,Where Duty Calls,"In a room in Lebanon
They silently slept
They were dreaming crazy dreams
In a foreign alphabet
Lucky young boys
Cross on the main
The driver was approaching
The American zone
The waving of hands
The tiniest train
They never dreamed
They'd never wake again
Voice of the Swarm
We follow we fall
Some kneel for priests
Some wail at walls
Flag on a match head
God or the law
And they'll all go together
Where duty calls
United children
Child of Iran
Parallel prayers
Baseball Koran
I'll protect mama
I'll lie awake
I'll die for Allah
In a holy war
I'll be a ranger
I'll guard the streams
I'll be a soldier
A sleeping marine
In the heart of the ancient
Ali smiles
In the soul of the desert
The sun blooms awake
Into the glare of all our little wars
Who pray to return to salute
The coming and dying of the moon
Oh sleeping sun
Assassin in prayer
Laid a compass deep
Exploding dawn
And himself as well
Their eyes for his eyes
Their breath for his breath
All to his end
And a room in Lebanon
Dust of scenes
Erase and blend
May the blanket of kings
Cover them and him
Forgive them Father
They know not what they do
From the vast portals
Of their consciousness
They're calling to you
-This was written in memory of those who lost their lives in the
Destruction of the First Battalion, 8th Marine Headquarters, Beirut, October 23, 1983. Two hundred and forty-one marines, sailors, and

Suffer not Your neighbor's paralysis
But extend your hand
Extend your hand
Lest you vanish in the city
And be but a trace
Just a vanished ghost
And your legacy

Science, mathematics, thought
Severely weakened Like irrigation systems

All the world revolved Around a perfect circle
City of Baghdad City of scholars
Empirical humble Center of the world
City in ashes City of Baghdad
City of Baghdad Abrasive aloof

Oh, in Mesopotamia
Aloofness ran deep
Deep in the veins of the great rivers
That form the base Of Eden

The tree of knowledge
Held up its arms To the sky

Rising from the ashes like
A speckled bird Splayed against the mosaic sky
Oh, clouds around
We created the zero
But we mean nothing to you
You would believe
That we are just some mystical tale
We are just a swollen belly
That gave birth to Sinbad, Scheherazade
We gave birth
Oh, oh, to the zero
The perfect number
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you
Our children run through the streets
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars
Shock and awe Shock and awe

No chivalry involved No Bushido

Never been Where does it lie?
You came, you came Through the west
Annihilated a people
And you come to us
But we are older than you
You come you wanna
You wanna come and rob the cradle
Of civilization
And you read yet you read
You read Genesis You read of the tree
You read of the tree
Beget by god
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge
Of the cradle of civilization
Of the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep
The face of Eve turning
What sky did she see
What garden beneath her feet
The one you drill
You drill
Pulling the blood of the earth
Little droplets of oil for bracelets
Little jewels
Sapphires
You make bracelets round your own world
We are weeping tears
Rubies
We offer them to you
We are just Your Arabian nightmare
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you
Your Arabian nightmare
City of stars City of scholarship
Science City of ideas
City of light City
City of ashes
That the great Caliph
Walked through His naked feet formed a circle
And they built a city A perfect city of Baghdad
In the realm of peace And all the world revolved
And they invented
And they mean nothing to you
Nothing to you
Nothing
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child
Go to sleep And I'll sing you a lullaby
A lullaby for our city A lullaby of Baghdad
Go to sleep
Sleep my child

80,Patti Smith,Memento Mori,"The fan whirling like the blades of a copter
Lifting into the skies above a foreign land
Fire and iron soaked with the bodies of so many friends
Johnny waved. He was on his way home
He waved good-bye to his comrades in arms
And all the twisted things he had seen
He waved good-bye
And the blades hit something
Maybe just fate but the blades hit
The copter went up in flames
And Johnny never went marching home
And Johnny never went marching home
They took his name and they carved it on a slab of marble
With several thousand other names
All the fallen idols
The apples of their mother's eye
Just another name
Meanwhile back on the burning shore
Johnny's comrades stood speechless
They looked with misbelieving eyes
Cause there were bits of metal and the embers
The embers of his eyes fanned out in the air
Black dust flames. Oh Johnny
Someday they'll make a movie about you
And in the making of that movie, some mad apocalypse
It will become even stranger than the simple act
Just a boy going up. Up. Up
Just a boy going. Up. Up
In flames the smoke
Just another life
Just another breath
And who'll remember
Oh eternity now
As eternal as a sheet of marble
Eternal as a slab
On a green hill
And your name
And all your fallen brothers
And all the ones not cut
All the ones remembered
Only in the hearts
A mother a father a brother
A sister a lover son daughter
Young man shall not fade shall not fade
Your ancestors salute you greet you
And the gods of your ancestors salute you
Having been formed by the mind of your ancestors
The gods of your ancestors salute you
Having been formed by your ancestors
The gods of your ancestors salute you
They draw you in
They draw you through
They draw they draw you
Through that golden door
Come on boy
We remember you
We conceived you
We conceived of your breath
We conceived of the whole human race
And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing
Like a tulip bending in the wind
Sometimes it comes back to us
In the form of the hand filled with dust
Comes back in the form of a smitten child
Our raped daughters
The broken bones
Souls cleaved of hearts
They come back to us
Our hands are filled
With their rotting tissues
But we turn not our backs
We press our lips
Into their cancer
Into the dust
Into the remains of each one
And that love is there
And will greet you
Come on in boy
It's eternal love
Well here go ahead
Run through that plane
Oh man running through your mind
You took a cat
You took a life
You took it by the tail
And you swirled it around your head
And you thrashed it
You smashed the life out of it
Then you knew that would be your own
But you wanted to feel the dying
Because you knew
You would feel your own
You would feel your own
But you're remembered
You're remembered
You're remembered good
We remember
We remember
We remember
EverythingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
81,Patti Smith,Gung Ho,"On a field of red one gold star
Raised above his head
Raised above his head
He was not like any other
He was just like any other
And the song they bled
Was a hymn to him
Awake my little one
The seed of revolution
Sewn in the sleeve
Of cloth humbly worn
Where others are adorned
Above the northern plain
The great birds fly
With great wings
Over the paddy fields
And the people kneel
And the men they toil
Yet not for their own
And the children are hungry
And the wheel groans
There before a grass hut
A young boy stood
His mother lay dead
His sisters cried for bread
And within his young heart
The seed of revolution sewn
In cloth humbly worn
While others are adorned
And he grew into a man
Not like any other
Just like any other
One small man
A beard the color of rice
A face the color of tea
Who shared the misery
Of other men in chains
With shackles on his feet
Escaped the guillotine
Who fought against
Colonialism imperialism
Who remained awake
While others slept
Who penned like Jefferson
Let independence ring
And the cart of justice turns
Slow and bitterly
And the people were crying
Plant that seed that seed
And they crawled on their bellies
Beneath the giant beast
And filled the carts with bodies
Where once had been their crops
And the great birds swarm
Spread their wings overhead
And his mother dead
And the typhoons and the rain
The jungles in flames
And the orange sun
None could be more beautiful
Than Vietnam
Nothing was more beautiful
Than Vietnam
And his heart stopped beating
And the wheel kept turning
And the words he bled
Were a hymn to them
I have served the whole people
I have served my whole country
And as I leave this world
May you suffer union
And my great affection
Limitless as sky
Filled with golden stars
The question is raised
Raised above his head
Was he of his word
Was he a good man
For his image fills the southern heart
With none but bitterness
And the people keep crying
And the men keep dying
And it's so beautiful
So beautiful
Give me one more turn
Give me one more turn
One more turn of the wheel
One more revolution
One more turn of the wheelEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
82,Patti Smith,Dead to the World,"Dead to the world my body was sleeping
On my mind was nothing at all
Come a mist an air so appealing
I'm here a whisper you summoned I called
I formed me a presence whose aspect was changing
Oh he would shift he would not shift at all
We sat for a while he was very engaging
And when he was gone I was gone on a smile

With a strange way of walking
And a strange way of breathing
More lives than a cat
That led me astray
All in all he captured my heart
Dead to the world and I just
Slipped away

I heard me a music that drew me to dancing
Lo I turned under his spell
I opened my coat but he never came closer
I bolted the door and I whispered oh well
I laid in the rushes the air was upon me
Wondering well I just couldn't discern
Will he come back come back to me
Oh I whispered will you ever return
I was feeling sensations in no dictionary
He was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke
The life in his fingers unwound my existence
Dead to the world alive I awoke

With a strange way of walking
And a strange way of breathing
Less than a breath of shimmer and smoke
The life in his finger unwound my existence
Dead to the world alive I awokeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

We don't give a shit
Ladies' lost electricity;
Take vows inside of it

84,Patti Smith,Within You Without You,"We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
And I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider

86,Patti Smith,Notes to the Future,"Listen my children and you shall hear
The sound of your own steps
The sound of your hereafter
Memory awaits and turns to greet you
Draping its banner across your wrists
Wake up arms
Delicate feet
For as one to march the streets
Each alone, each part of another
Your steps shall ring
Shall raise the cloud
And they that will hear will hear
Will hear voice of the one
And the one and the one
As it has never been uttered before
For something greater yet to come
Then the hour of the prophets
And their great cities
For the people of Ninevah
Fell to their knees
Heeding the cry of Jonah
United
Covering themselves in sackcloth and ashes
And called to their god
And all their hearts were as one heart
And all their voices were as one voice
God heard them and his mind was moved
Yet something greater will come to pass
And who will call?
And what will they call?
Will they call to God?
The air?
The fowl?
It will not matter, if the call is true
They shall call and this is known
One voice and each another
Shall enter the dead, the living flower
Enter forms that we know not
To be felt by sea
By air
By earth
And shall be an elemental pledge
This is our birthright
This is our charge
And we have given over to others
And they have
Not
Done
Well
And the forests mourn
The leaves fall
Swaddling babes watch and wonder
As the fathers of our spirit nations
Dance in the street in celebration
As the mountains turn pale from
Their nuclear hand
And they have
Not
Done
Well
Now my children
You must overturn the tables
Deliver the future from material rule
For only one rule should be considered
The eleventh commandment
To love one another
And this is our covenant across your wrist
This offering is yours
To adorn, adore
To bury
To burn
Upon a mound
To hail
To set away
It is merely a cloth
Merely our colors
Invested with the blood of the people
All their hopes and dreams
Our flag
It has its excellence
Yet it is nothing
It shall not be a tyranny above us
Nor should god
Nor love
Nor nature
Yet we hold as our pleasure this tender honor
That we acknowledge the individual
And the common ground formed
And if our cloth be raised and lowered
Half mast
What does it tell us?
That an individual has passed
Is saluted
And mourned by his countrymen
This ritual extends to us all
For we are all the individual
No unknown
No insignificant one
Nor insignificant labor
Nor insignificant act of charity
Each has a story to be told and retold
Which shall be a glowing thread
In the fabric of Man
And the children shall march
And bring the colors forward
Investing within them
The redeeming blood
Of their revolutionary heartsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
87,Patti Smith,Gandhi,"I had a dream Mr. King If you'll beg my pardon
I was trespassing
A sacred garden

And they dropped like candy
And nature cried

Gandhi Gandhi
When he was a boy He was afraid of the dark
His mother would fast And pray at his feet
And the lamp burned as he slept Slept as he dreamed
He was dreaming of his sisters Dressed in white muslin
Dressed in white muslin Dancing in a ring
He was afraid of the dark And the lamp burned
And his mother fasted And prayed as he slept
Dreaming of blossoms They were burning his throat
He had eaten flowers Fell burning
Flowers fell burning From the young girls' hair
He was whispering Into his god's ear
Let the children be so
Let the children be so
And the lamplight flickered flickered
And his mother withered like Job
And he lay there dreaming
And the blossoms fell
And Tilak's trumpet
Proceeded to call
And the blossoms fell
And they dropped like candy
And the people cried

88,Patti Smith,Death Singing,"In the straw-colored light
In light rapidly changing
On a life rapidly fading
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
With a throat smooth as a lamb
Yet dry as a branch not snapping
He throws back his head
And he does not sing a thing mournful
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light
He sings a black embrace
And white opals swimming
In a child's leather purse
Have you seen death swimming
Have you seen death swimming
With a throat smooth as a lamb
Yet dry as a branch not snapping
He throws back his head
And does not sing a thing mournful
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light
He sings of youth enraged
And the burning of Atlanta
And these viral times
And May ribbons streaming
And straw-colored curls a'turning
A mother's vain delight
And woe to the sun
And woe to the dawn
And woe to the young
Another hearse is drawn
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored lightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
89,Patti Smith,Mosaic,"Last night in Konya
A voice carried me
To the pulpit of the arrow
Did you hear it too?
The oracle was written
On a silver leaf
Last night I read the words
Did you read them too?
Precious heart, precious seed
Precious life conceived
In the ring of fire
In the sleep of peace
Nothing stops desire
For the human beat
Last night was a rapture
In the mosaic sky
Dropping shards of love
Dropping shards of love
Precious heart, precious seed
Precious life conceived
In the ring of fire
In the sleep of peace
Nothing stops desire
For the human beat
I hunger for the cooling flame
I hunger for the infinite game
Last night in Konya
A voice carried me
To the pulpit of the arrow
Did you hear it too?
The oracle was written
On a silver leaf
Last night I read the words
Did you read them too?
Devour me, ah, devour me
Oh precious life
Oh precious seed
Oh precious heart
That beats
In a ring of fire
In a sleep of peace
Nothing stops
The human beat

90,Patti Smith,We Three Kings,"We three kings of orient are, bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain, following yonder star
Oh, star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide with thy perfect light
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King for ever, ceasing never over us all to reign. .....
Frankincense to offer have I, incense owns a Deity nigh
Pray'are and praising, all men raising
Worship him, God most high, oh.....
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume breathes a life of
Gathering gloom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, sealed in the stone cold tomb

Alleluia, alleluia, heaven to earth replies...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Doves shall multiply
Yet I see hawks circling the sky
Scattering our glad day
With debt and despair
What good hour
Will restore our troubled air?
Come on people
Gather round You know what to do
Come on people Oh my land
What be troubling Oh my land
What be troubling What be troubling
What be troubling you
We are love and the future
We stand in the midst of fury and weariness
Who dreams of joy and radiance?
Who dreams of war and sacrifice?
Our sacred realms are being squeezed
Curtailing civil liberties

93,Patti Smith,Ravens,"Common fortune seeks us all
And slips our binding rings
We'll turn our heads
And make us reel
We'll bare our arms as wings
Before our feet a feather drifts
Beyond us it will fall
Cause time will bid and make us rise

Make ravens of us all

My loved he breathed the air of kings
Yet fell beneath his luck
And in his heart a yearning yet
Before his time time shook
And all the gifts that god had gave
And those by fate denied
Gone to where all treasures laid

And where the raven flies

Oh there are places I agree
Where I have yet to roam
The Egyptian field the arctic sea
Where shadows haunt and moan
But none but sky I have to go
Should I return to thee
Gone to where the feather flies
To eternity
But for a time I got more time
Till I a raven be

Cause time will bid
And make us rise
Make ravens of us allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Passively station active patrol
Sliding in high noon
Like some reluctant sheriff
Not want to get involved in it all
Who stands guard for each other
Why must we guard anything at all
Anything at all
From the earth's four corners the people are calling
Forming equations but the questions are hard
All men are brothers killing each other
And mother earth is wringing in wonder
Who stands guard for each other
Why must we guard anything at all
Anything at all
Whirl away now
Whirl away now
Whirl away
There's a cross on the road, there's a great mill turning
Some seeking answers, some are born with answers
You can hold on the blade and turn around forever
Be flung into space into another kind of grace
=Who stands guard for each other
Why must we guard anything at all
Anything at all
Whirl away now
Whirl away now
Whirl away
Some give of the hand
Some give of their land
Some giveth their life
Lying in a field of grain
The staff of life all around you
Yet you will cut someone down
For their possessions
Some material thing
And our children are being blown away
Like wishes in the wind
For the sake of their coat
Or their colors or their code
Or the color of their skin
Or the name of their shoes
And the mother cries why'd they take my son
And the father wonders why'd they take my boy
He extended his hand he gave of his land
He gave of his bread he gave of his heart

Like a rabbit 'cross the moon
Shines of light over your hair
As boys croon
Pretty in pink It makes me wonder
What could ever bring you down I see tears falling
From those eyes of brown
Hearing a voice, you turn your head
You vanish into the mist
Of your thoughts
And I
Want to grasp
What brings you down
Open up those eyes of brown
The world is changing
Your heart is growing
Hearing a voice you turn your head
Girls turn by ones, by twos
Notes pour bad and tender
Eradicate your blues

Girls sing notes from heaven
Birds lift them up to the sky
I see brown eyes
That see girls turning
Girls turning

96,Patti Smith,Trespasses,"Life is designed
With unfinished lines
That another sings
Each story unfolds
Like it was gold
Upon a ragged wing
The bold and the fair
Suffer their share
He whispered to his kin
All of my debts
Left with regrets
I'm sorry for everything
Trespasses stretch
Like broken fences
Winding as they may
Trespasses stretch
Like broken fences
Hope to mend them one day
And she pinned back her hair
Shouldered with care
The burdens that were his
Mending the coat
That hung on the post
In heart remembering
Trespasses stretch
Like broken fences
Winding as they may
Trespasses stretch
Like broken fences
Hope to mend them one day
And her time was to come
Called to her son
This your song to sing
All of our debts
Wove with regrets
Upon a golden string
And he found the old coat
Hung on a post
Like a ragged wing
And took as his own
The sewn and unsown
Joyfully whistlingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
97,Patti Smith,It Takes Time,"No equation
To explain the division of the senses
No sound to reflect
The radiance of time
In the beginningest dream
Halls of disorder
Where we are swept to encircle dawn
Strapped in a low car
Racing thru silence
Trumpeting bliss
You could kiss the world
Goodbye
Standing outside the courthouse
In the rain
Seemed like a lost soul
From the chapel of dreams
With a handful of images
Faces of children
Phases of the moon
One little thing you get wrong
Changes the dimensions
Streets, swept memory
Diffused and lost
Like a prayer in the sun
Sometimes you can't tell
Whether you're waking up
Or going to sleep
Spiralling
Unnumbered streets
All the games cannot be yours
All the sights, the treasures of the eye
Does the divided soul remain the same?
No equation to explain
Destiny's hand
Moved, by love
Drawn by the whispering shadows
Into the mathematics
Of our desireEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
98,Patti Smith,One Voice,"In the garden of consciousness
In fertile mind there lies the dormant seed
When blooming as charity
Conscience breathes a sigh of relief
The confessions of sleep
The awakening seed
Moved by love to serve
We celebrate all
Merit in life
Ah, the confessions of sleep
Unfolding peace
As we extend
According to need
And you will hear the call
All action great and small
Received joyfully
Heaven abounds
Let love resound
If he be mute
Give him a bell
If he be blind, an eye
It he be down, a hand
Lift up your voice
Lift up your voice
Lift up your voice
Give of your mind one mind
Give of your heart one heart
Give of your voice

99,Patti Smith,Cash,"Here we go around again
Curve of life spiraling
Everything we've ever known
As the seed of life gets blown
And the miracle of time
When will that time just end
Remember, you decide
Take that vow
Grab that ring
It's not a whim
Not a whim
When you be cashing in
Try to turn your life around
And all the things you do resound
And then you can't loose control
Say your time has come and then
Hard to pinpoint find the seam
Where that one time ends
Where that time begins
Remember, you decide
Take that vow
Take a stand
Grab that ring
It's not a whim
It's not a whim
It's only time
That you're cashing in
In the white noise of desire
We can't hear a single thing
Floating round the fragile bough
Afflictions of the human soul
Its beauty immaterial
You decide
Stand along
The fallen ones
Take revenge
Defeated sons
Rend that coat
From seam to seam
It's only time
It's only time
That you spend
You spend
It's only time
You spend
Its only time
You spend
It's only life
That you're cashing inEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

101,Joni Mitchell,A Case of You,"Just before our love got lost you said
""I am as constant as a northern star""
And I said, ""Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar""
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me, you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
"
102,Joni Mitchell,Both Sides Now,"Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
At all
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life

103,Joni Mitchell,River,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
"
104,Joni Mitchell,Blue,"Blue
Songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

Hey, blue
There is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

Well, there's so many sinking now
You gotta keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs
Lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that
Hell's the hippest way to go
Well, I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it, though
Blue, I love you
Blue, there is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
"
105,Joni Mitchell,California,"Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't wanna stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here

Oh, but California
California, I'm coming home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California, I'm coming home

I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh, the rogue, the red red rogue
He cooked good omelets and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there

But my heart cried out for you, California
Oh, California, I'm coming home
Oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home
Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues

So I bought me a ticket
I got on a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
They said, ""How long can you hang around?""
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown

Then I'm going home to California
California, I'm coming home
Oh, will you take me as I am
Strung out on another man
California, I'm coming home

Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Oh, will you take me as I am?
Will you take me as I am?
Will you?
Will you take me as I am?
Hmmm mmmmm
"
106,Joni Mitchell,All I Want,"I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be?
Oh, I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh, I love you when I forget about me
I want to be strong, I want to laugh along
I want to belong to the living
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want, do you want, do you want to dance with me, baby?
Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me, baby?
Well, come on

All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I want to talk to you, I want to shampoo you
I want to renew you again and again
Applause, applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses, my mind see-saws
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me, baby?
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh, the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I want to have fun, I want to shine like the sun
Want to be the one that you want to see
I want to knit you a sweater
Want to write you a love letter
I want to make you feel better
I want to make you feel free
Want to make you feel free

107,Joni Mitchell,Little Green,"Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she will answer to
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her
Call her green for the children who've made her
Little green, be a gypsy dancer

He went to California
Hearing that everything's warmer there
So you write him a letter and say ""Her eyes are blue""
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Little green, he's a non-conformer

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you are sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
You're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed
Little green, have a happy ending
Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
"
108,Joni Mitchell,My Old Man,"My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark

We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay, baby

We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms

We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man
Keeping away my blues

But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man

109,Joni Mitchell,Carey,"The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And my fancy French cologne

Oh, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you fine

Come on down to the Mermaid Café and I will
Buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town
Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy
But I like you

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne
Oh, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy
"
110,Joni Mitchell,Woodstock,"I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, ""Where are you going?""
And this he told me
I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna try and get my soul free

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
"
111,Joni Mitchell,The Last Time I Saw Richard,"The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me, ""All romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark café
""You laugh,"" he said, ""you think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies?
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies""

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said ""Drink up now, it's gettin' on time to close.""
""Richard, you haven't really changed,"" I said, it's just that
Now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreamy
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way someday
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafés
Dark cafés, only a dark cocoon
Before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
"
112,Joni Mitchell,The Circle Game,"Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times 'round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like ""when you're older"" must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him, ""Take your time, it won't be long now
'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down""

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

So, the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
"
113,Joni Mitchell,Coyote,"No regrets Coyote
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a broodmare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel-to-reel
There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit and run driver no no
Racing away
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some road house lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take no
He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
I looked a coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running thru the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking thru keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them thru this passion play
No regrets Coyote
I just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
From appaloosas and eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free free wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
114,Joni Mitchell,This Flight Tonight,"Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there, that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors

Oh, starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you, baby, I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Up there's the heavens
Down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
Come on, light the candle in this poor heart of mine
Oh, starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing ""Goodbye, baby
Baby, goodbye
Ooh ooh, love is blind""
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on, baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again, baby

Starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
"
115,Joni Mitchell,Amelia,"I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
It was the strings of my guitar
Amelia  it was just a false alarm

The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture post card charms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

People will tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Others just come to harm
Oh, Amelia it was just a false alarm

I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm
A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s
Over geometric farms
"
116,Joni Mitchell,Hejira,"I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shock love away
There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today
In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed
I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen
Strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through the snow and the pinewood trees
I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones *
I know no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone
Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality
In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years
We're only particles of change I know I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone
White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
"
117,Joni Mitchell,Help Me,"Help me, I think I'm falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man and you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good

Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too
"
118,Joni Mitchell,Cactus Tree,"There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green
He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds
While she was busy being free

There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
He calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same
He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers
Of a forest tree
While she was somewhere being free
There's a man who's sent a letter
And he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels
Since the day they said goodbye
He writes ""Wish you were beside me
We can make it if we try""
He has seen her at the office
With her name on all his papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory
And she's so busy being free

There's a lady in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl
She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity
And she's so busy being free
There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
There's a drummer and a dreamer
And you know there may be more
She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree
While she's so busy being free

Like a cactus tree

119,Joni Mitchell,For Free,"I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I'll play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on their TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good for freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
120,Joni Mitchell,Free Man in Paris,"The way I see it he said
You just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favours
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers
And telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If l had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-Élysées
Going café to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find
That very good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favours
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery
Behind the popular songEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
121,Joni Mitchell,Chelsea Morning,"Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second
Now the curtain opens
On a portait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
"
122,Joni Mitchell,Ladies of the Canyon,"Trina wears her wampum beads
She fills her drawing book with lines
Sewing lace on widows weeds
And filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leave are filigree
And her coat's a second hand one
Trimmed with antique luxury
She is a lady of the canyon
Annie sits you down to eat
She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying ""you are welcome back""
She is another canyon lady
Estrella, circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At bevelled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and bevelled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon
Trina takes her pins and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
123,Joni Mitchell,People’s Parties,"All the people at this party
They've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries
They've got passport smiles
Some are friendly, some are cutting
Some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre
Giving to get something

Photo beauty gets attention
Then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth
And a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy
Then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying laughing and crying
You know it's the same release

I told you when I met you I was crazy
Cry for us all beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner
Thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence
Thinking I don't understand
I feel like I'm sleeping
Can you wake me
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings
With a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to people's parties
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind

I wish I had more sense of humor
Keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
"
124,Joni Mitchell,Court and Spark,"Love came to my door
With a sleeping roll
And a madman's soul
He thought for sure I'd seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman
To court and spark

He was playing on the sidewalk
For passing change
When something strange happened
Glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made
In People's Park
And went looking for a woman
To court and spark

It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him and still acting kind
He saw how I worried, sometimes
I worry sometimes

""All the guilty people,"" he said
""They've all seen the stain
On their daily bread
On their Christian names
I cleared myself, I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me
I'd complete you.""
His eyes were the color of the sand
And the sea
And the more he talked to me, you know
The more he reached me
But I couldn't let go of L.A
City of the fallen angelsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
125,Joni Mitchell,Song for Sharon,"I went to Staten Island, Sharon
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke
Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the ""Big Apple"" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says ""Have children""
Mama and Betsy say ""Find yourself a charity
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology""
Well there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want to do right now
Is find another lover
When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are twenty-nine skaters on Wollman Rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and
Stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me
Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and byEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
126,Joni Mitchell,The Hissing of Summer Lawns,"He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns
He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his
To a latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns
Darkness
Wonder makes it easy
Darkness
With a joyful mask
Darkness
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
No color no contrast
A diamond dog
Carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns
He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale
That nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
"
127,Joni Mitchell,That Song about the Midway,"I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playin' on the horses; you were playin' on the guitar strings;
You were playin' like a devil wearin' wings
Wearin' wings, you looked so grand wearin' wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing?
Can you fly? I heard you can, can you fly?
Like an eagle doin' your huntin' from the sky

I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover; you were shaking up the dice;
And I thought I saw you cheatin' once or twice
Once or twice, I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wond'rin' was the gamble worth the price?
Pack it in, I heard you did, pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win?

So lately you've been hidin', it was somewhere in the news;
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues;
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine;
And I feel like I've been workin' overtime
Over time, I've lost my fire, over time
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down, I'm gettin' tired, slowin' down;
And I envy you the valley that you've found
Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down
Down, down, downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
128,Joni Mitchell,"You Turn Me On, I’m a Radio","If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you
Oh honey, you turn me on
I'm a radio
I'm a country station
I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower
Waving for you
I'm a broadcasting tower
Waving for you
And I'm sending you out
This signal here
I hope you can pick it up
Loud and clear

I know you don't like weak women
You get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women
'Cause they're hip to your tricks
It's been dirty for dirty
Down the line
But you know I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind
But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me
Then tune me out, 'cause honey
Who needs the static
It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking
And the day goes dismal
From ""Breakfast Barney""
To the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm going to tell you again now
If you're still listening there
If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you
If you're lying on the beach
With the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies, honey
The love's still flowing
If your head says forget it
But your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station
"
129,Joni Mitchell,Down to You,"Everything comes and goes
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
Things that you held high
And told yourself were true
Lost or changing as the days come down to you
Down to you
Constant stranger
You're a kind person
You're a cold person too
It's down to you
It all comes down to you

You go down to the pick up station
Craving warmth and beauty
You settle for less than fascination
A few drinks later you're not so choosy
When the closing lights strip off the shadows
On this strange new flesh you've found
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
You hurry
To the blackness
And the blankets
To lay down an impression
And your loneliness
In the morning there are lovers in the street
They look so high
You brush against a stranger
And you both apologize
Old friends seem indifferent
You must have brought that on
Old bonds have broken down
Love is gone
Oooh love is gone
Written on your spirit this sad song
Love is gone

Everything comes and goes
Pleasure moves on too early
And trouble leaves too slow
Just when you're thinking
You've finally got it made
Bad news comes knocking
At your garden gate
Knocking for you
Constant stranger
You're a brute you're an angel
You can crawl you can fly too
It's down to you
It all comes down to youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
130,Joni Mitchell,I Had a King,"I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
He's cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting-

I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind

I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can
I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year

I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never canEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
131,Joni Mitchell,Conversation,"He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafes
And I only say, ""Hello""
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him, like a ring
To wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him

Secrets and sharing soda
That's how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
It's second hand
But I'll listen to his questions
I'll give my answers when they're found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know she keeps him down
She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I don't believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And he'll speak his sorrows endlessly and he'll ask me why
Why can't I leave her?
He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
He knows that's what he'll findEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
132,Joni Mitchell,Same Situation,"Again and again the same situation
For so many years
Tethered to a ringing telephone
In a room full of mirrors
A pretty girl in your bathroom
Checking out her sex appeal
I asked myself when you said you loved me
Do you think this can be real?

Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering where it had to go
With heaven full of astronauts
And the Lord on death row
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Call out and clamour to be found
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And their search for love that sticks around

You've had lots of lovely women
Now you turn your gaze to me
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
To see if I'm worthy
Like the church, like a cop, like a mother
You want me to be truthful
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
And I need your approval
Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering who was there to hear
I said, ""Send me somebody
Who's strong and somewhat sincere""
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
I called out to be released
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
And my search for love
That don't seem to ceaseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
133,Joni Mitchell,Furry Sings the Blues,"Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar boarded up now
And Egles the Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the grey decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel
There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent staring at her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter ghosts history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and says
""I don't like you""
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W. C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fey
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
"
134,Joni Mitchell,Blue Motel Room,"I've got a blue motel room
With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I'm down
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I get back to town
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles
Honey, tell them you've got germs
I hope you'll be thinking of me
Because I'll be thinking of you
While I'm traveling home alone
Tell those girls that you've got Joni
She's coming back home

I've got road maps
From two dozen states
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate
Will you still love me
When I get back to town
It's funny how these old feelings hang around
You think they're gone
No, no
They just go underground
Will you still love me
When I get back to L.A. town
You and me, we're like America and Russia
We're always keeping score
We're always balancing the power
And that can get to be a cold cold war
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
In some neutral café
You lay down your sneaking round the town honey
And I'll lay down the highway
I've got a blue motel room
With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me
When I get back to townEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
135,Joni Mitchell,The Gallery,"When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
Then you began to hang up me
You studied to portray me
In ice and greens
And old blue jeans
And naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes
That all your work discloses

""Lady, don't love me now I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart,"" that's what you said
You said, ""I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you""

Somewhere in a magazine
I found a page about you
I see that now it's Josephine
Who cannot be without you
I keep your house in fit repair
I dust the portraits daily
Your mail comes here from everywhere
The writing looks like ladies'
""Lady, please love me now, I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart,"" that's what you said
You said, ""I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you""

I gave you all my pretty years
Then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here
While you went west for pleasure
And now you're flying back this way
Like some lost homing pigeon
They've monitored your brain, you say
And changed you with religion

""Lady, please love me now I was dead
I am no saint, turn down your bed
Lady, have you no heart,"" that's what you said
Well, I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you

When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me
And all their eyes look shadyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
136,Joni Mitchell,Twisted,"My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
The way he described it
He said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along
That he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought
I was crazy but I'm not
Oh no

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
He said I need treatment
But I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type
That was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts

They say as a child
I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas
But I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know
That you're a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be
Now I heard little children
Were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic
Didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes
Before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three
But I was swinging

They all laugh at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry
If they just couldn't understand
The idiomatic logic
That went on in my head
I had a brain, it was insane
Oh, they used to laugh at me
When I refused to ride
On those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
But I said, ""Dear doctor
I think that it's you instead
Because I, I got a thing
That's unique and new
To prove it I'll have
The last laugh on you
'Cause instead of one head
I got two
And you know two heads are better than one""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
137,Joni Mitchell,For the Roses,"I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Did you get a round resounding for you
Way up here
It seems like many dim years ago
Since I heard that face to face
Or seen you face to face
Though tonight I can feel you here
I get these notes
On butterflies and lilac sprays
From girls who just have to tell me
They saw you somewhere

In some office sits a poet
And he trembles as he sings
And he asks some guy
To circulate his soul around
On your mark red ribbon runner
The caressing rev of motors
Finely tuned like fancy women
In thirties evening gowns
Up the charts
Off to the airport
Your name's in the news
Everything's first class
The lights go down
And it's just you up there
Getting them to feel like that
Remember the days when you used to sit
And make up your tunes for love
And pour your simple sorrow
To the soundhole and your knee
And now you're seen
On giant screens
And at parties for the press
And for people who have slices of you
From the company
They toss around your latest golden egg
Speculation well who's to know
If the next one in the nest
Will glitter for them so

I guess I seem ungrateful
With my teeth sunk in the hand
That brings me things
I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here the critic
And they introduce some band
But they seem so much confetti
Looking at them on my TV set
Oh the power and the glory
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers
And the boards
And the nails
I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Chilly now
End of summer
No more shiny hot nights
It was just the arbutus rustling
And the bumping of the logs
And the moon swept down black water
"
138,Joni Mitchell,I Don’t Know Where I Stand,"Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote ""I love you"" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I standEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
139,Joni Mitchell,In France They Kiss on Main Street,"Downtown
My darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence
Rock 'n' roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs
A girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading
In a suburban room
I said take me to the dance
Do you want to dance?
I love to dance
And I told him
They don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches & schools
And molded to middle class circumstance

And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
The dance halls and cafes
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise
In those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
Drinking up the band's beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars
Kissing in cafes
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
In the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing ""Bye, Bye, Love""
While he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys
Come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car
Or Ron had the car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said

And we'd be rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rolling
Rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

140,Joni Mitchell,Morning Morgantown,"When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milk trucks make their morning rounds
In morning Morgantown
We'll rise up early, with the sun
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
And the day is young
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning Morgantown
Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink at total strangers passing
In morning Morgantown
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning in any town you name
Morning's just the same

I'd like to buy you everything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colored rings
In morning Morgantown
But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same
Morning's just the sameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
141,Joni Mitchell,The Boho Dance,"Down in the cellar in the Boho Zone
I went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
Just another hard-time band
With Negro affectations
I was a hopeful in rooms like this
When I was working cheap
It's an old romance, the Boho dance
It hasn't gone to sleep

But even on the scuffle
The cleaner's press was in my jeans
And any eye for detail
Caught a little lace along the seams

And you were in the parking lot
Subterranean by your own design
The virtue of your style inscribed
On your contempt for mine
Jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance
Have a fascination for me
A camera pans the cocktail hour
Behind a blind of potted palms
And finds a lady in a Paris dress
With runs in her nylons

You read those books where luxury
Comes as a guest to take a slave
Books where artists in noble poverty
Go like virgins to the grave
Don't you get sensitive on me
'Cause I know you're just too proud
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now
Even if good fortune allowed

Like a priest with a pornographic watch
Looking and longing on the sly
Sure it's stricken from your uniform
But you can't get it out of your eyes

Nothing is capsulized in me
On either side of town
The streets were never really mine
Not mine these glamour gownsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
142,Joni Mitchell,Raised on Robbery,"He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion
He was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
She says: ""Let me sit down
You know, drinkin' alone's a shame
(It's a shame, it's a crying shame)
Look at those jokers
Glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey, you've got lots of cash
Bring us 'round a bottle
And we'll have some laughs

Gin's what I'm drinking
I was raised on robbery""

I'm a pretty good cook
I'm sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen
I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up after midnight cooking
Trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasin'
I was raised on robbery

We had a little money once
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars
You should have seen it fly away
First he bought a '57 Biscayne
He put it in a ditch
He drunk up all the rest
That son of a bitch

His blood's bad whiskey
I was raised on robbery

You know you ain't bad looking
I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey
I ain't asking for no full length mink
Hey, where you going? Don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when you're loaded
I was raised on robberyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
143,Joni Mitchell,Tin Angel,"Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories
Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback
Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today

Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden Prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun
Still I'll take a chance and see
I found someone to love today

There's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him
In a Bleecker Street cafe
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love todayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
144,Joni Mitchell,Sex Kills,"I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
I took a look at his license plate
It said 'Just Ice'
Is justice just ice?
Governed by greed and lust
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must

Oh, and the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills

Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers haven't been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs
Know the balance is undone, crazy ions
You can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills

All these jack-offs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh, and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packing guns to school
The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down
On the massive mess we're in

And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills
Sex killsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
145,Joni Mitchell,Rainy Night House,"It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With you father's gun, alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see, who in the world I might be

I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see, who in the world you might be

You called me beautiful
You called your mother - she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
"
146,Joni Mitchell,Willy,"Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me
But for an ancient injury
That has not healed
He said I feel once again
Like I gave my heart too soon
He stood looking through the lace
At the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill
And the stars on my window sill
There are still more reasons why
I love him

Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says our love cannot be real
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know it's hard to tell
When you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's real
But you're bound to lose
If you let the blues get you scared to feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are so many reasons why I love him
Willy is my child, he is my fatherEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
147,Joni Mitchell,Edith and the Kingpin,"The big man arrives
Disco dancers greet him
Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening
Sophomore jive
From victims of typewriters
The band sounds like typewriters
The big man he's not listening
His eyes hold Edith
His left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire
That he grips it so tight

Edith in the ring
The passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring
His renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
Women he has taken grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon
Edith in his bed
A plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming
Some song - some mysterious song
Bars in her head
Beating frantic and snowblind
Romantic and snowblind
She says - his crime belongs
Edith and the Kingpin
Each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye
They dare not look away
You know they dare not look awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
148,Joni Mitchell,Don’t Interrupt the Sorrow,"Don't interrupt the sorrow
Darn right
In flames our prophet witches
Be polite
A room full of glasses
He says, ""Your notches, liberation doll""
And he chains me with that serpent
To that Ethiopian wall

Anima rising
Queen of Queens
Wash my guilt of Eden
Wash and balance me
Anima rising
Uprising in me tonight
She's a vengeful little goddess
With an ancient crown to fight

Truth goes up in vapors
The steeples lean
Winds of change patriarchs
Snug in your bible belt dreams
God goes up the chimney
Like childhood Santa Claus
The good slaves love the good book
A rebel loves a cause
I'm leaving on the 1:15
You're darn right
Since I was seventeen
I've had no one over me
He says ""Anima rising-
So what-
Petrified wood process
Tall timber down to rock!""

Don't interrupt the sorrow
Darn right
He says, ""We walked on the moon
You be polite""
Don't let up the sorrow
Death and birth and death and birth and death and birth
He says, ""Bring that bottle kindly
And I'll pad your purse-
I've got a head full of quandary
And a mighty, mighty, mighty thirst""

Seventeen glasses
Rhine wine
Milk of the Madonna
Clandestine
He don't let up the sorrow
He lies and he cheats
It takes a heart like Mary's these days
When your man gets weakEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
149,Joni Mitchell,Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire,"Cold Blue Steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet Fire calling
""You can't deny me
Now you know what you need""
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief
Looking for Sweet Fire
Shadow of Lady Release

""Come with me
I know the way"" she says
""It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
Leave someone a letter?
You can come now
Or you can come later""

A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
Edgy - black cracks of the sky
""Pin-cushion-prick-
Fix this poor bad dreamer!""
""Money"" cold shadows reply
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire
Black soot of Lady Release
""Come with me
I know the way"" she says
""It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
Does it really matter
You can come now
Or you can come later?""

Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging
But it's indistinct
Someone's HI-Fi drumming Jelly Roll
Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Fall into Lady Release

""Come with me
I know the way"" she says
""It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
I mean what does it really matter?
You're going to come now
Or you're going to come later""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
150,Joni Mitchell,The Jungle Line,"Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line

In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line

The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line
There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
And metal skin and ivory birds
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
"
151,Joni Mitchell,Woman of Heart and Mind,"I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands
No child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise
You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl
When love makes a fool of me

After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed
Nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains
Push your papers
Win your medals
Fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side
I'm looking for affection and respect
A little passion
And you want stimulation-nothing more
That's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink
All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words
Or do you really feel it?
Do you really laugh?
Do you really care?
Do you really smile
When you smile?
You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best
And the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even tryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
152,Joni Mitchell,Refuge of the Roads,"I met a friend of spirit
He drank and womanized
Then I sat before his sanity
I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
""Heart and humor and humility""
He said, ""Will lighten up your heavy load""
I left him then for the refuge of the roads

I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beach town
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads

There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh, radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
'Til I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't wanna know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads
I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn, turn, turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sun gold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the Earth
Taken coming back from the moon
And you couldn't see a city
On that marbled bowling ball
Or a forest or a highway
Or me here least of all
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or this baggage overload
Westbound and rolling, taking refuge in the roadsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
153,Joni Mitchell,Car on a Hill,"I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio
He said he'd be over three hours ago
I've been waiting for his car on the hill
He makes friends easy
He's not like me
I watch for judgement anxiously
Now where in the city can that boy be

Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill

He's a real good talker, I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend
But there's still no buzzer, they roll on
And I'm waiting for his car on the hill
It always seems so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter
When there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark
Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hillEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
154,Joni Mitchell,A Strange Boy,"A strange boy is weaving
A course of grace and havoc
On a yellow skateboard
Thru midday sidewalk traffic
Just when I think he's foolish and childish
And I want him to be manly
I catch my fool and my child
Needing love and understanding

What a strange strange boy
He still lives with his family
Even the war and the navy
Couldn't bring him to maturity

He keeps referring back to school days
And clinging to his child
Fidgeting and bullied
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild
He asked me to be patient
Well I failed
""Grow up!"" I cried
And as the smoke was clearing he said
""Give me one good reason why""
What a strange strange boy
He sees the cars as sets of waves
Sequences of mass and space
He sees the damage in my face

We got high on travel
And we got drunk on alcohol
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
See how that feeling comes and goes
Like the pull of moon on tides
Now I am surf rising
Now parched ribs of sand at his side

What a strange strange boy
I gave him clothes and jewelry
I gave him my warm body
I gave him power over me

A thousand glass eyes were staring
In a cellar full of antique dolls
I found an old piano
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls
While the boarders were snoring
Under crisp white sheets of curfew
We were newly lovers then
We were fire in the stiff blue-haired house rulesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
155,Joni Mitchell,Not to Blame,"The story hit the news
From coast to coast
They said you beat the girl
You loved the most
Your charitable acts
Seemed out of place
With the beauty
With your fist marks on her face
Your buddies all stood by
They bet their fortunes
And their fame
That she was out of line
And you were not to blame

Six hundred thousand doctors
Are putting on rubber gloves
And they're poking
At the miseries made of love
They say they're learning
How to spot
The battered wives
Among all the women
They see bleeding through their lives
I bleed
For your perversity
These red words that make a stain
On your white-washed claim that
She was out of line
And you were not to blame
I heard your baby say
When he was only three
""Daddy, let's get some girls
One for you and one for me.""
His mother had the frailty
You despise
And the looks
You love to drive to suicide
Not one wet eye around
Her lonely little grave
Said: ""He was out of line, girl
You were not to blame.""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
156,Joni Mitchell,Harry’s House/Centerpiece,"Heatwaves on the runway
As the wheels set down
He takes his baggage off the carousel
He takes a taxi into town
Yellow schools of taxi fishes
Jonah in a ticking whale
Caught up at the light in the fishnet windows
Of Bloomingdale's
Watching those high fashion girls
Skinny black models with Raven curls
Beauty parlor blonds with credit card eyes
Looking for the chic and the fancy
To buy

He opens up his suitcase
In the continental suite
And people thirty stories down
Look like colored currents in the street
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof
Like a dragonfly on a tomb
And business men in button downs
Press into conference rooms
Battalions of paper-minded males
Talking commodities and sales
While at home their paper wives
And paper kids
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid
Yellow checkers for the kitchen
Climbing ivy for the bath
She is lost in House and Gardens
He's caught up in Chief of Staff
He drifts off into the memory
Of the way she looked in school
With her body oiled and shining
At the public swimming pool

The more I'm with you, pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
Our happiness will never cease
Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

We'll find a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece
Shining hair and shining skin
Shining as she reeled him in
To tell him like she did today
Just what he could do with Harry's House
And Harry's take home payEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
157,Joni Mitchell,Michael from Mountains,"Michael wakes you up with sweets
He takes you up streets and the rain comes down
Sidewalk markets locked up tight
And umbrellas bright on a grey background
There's oil on the puddles in taffeta patterns
That run down the drain
In colored arrangements
That Michael will change with a stick that he found

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

Michael brings you to a park
He sings and its dark when the clouds come by
Yellow slickers up on swings
Like puppets on strings hanging in the sky
They'll splash home to suppers in wallpapered kitchens
Their mothers will scold
But Michael will hold you
To keep away cold till the sidewalks are dry-
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

Michael leads you up the stairs
He needs you to care and you know you do
Cats come crying to the key
And dry you will be in a towel or two
There's rain in the window
There's sun in the painting that smiles on the wall
You want to know all
But his mountains have called so you never do-

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well
Someday I will know you very wellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
158,Joni Mitchell,Trouble Child,"Up in a sterilized room
Where they let you be lazy
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
And you got to change
And that's not easy
Dragon shining with all values known
Dazzling you, keeping you from your own
Where is the lion in you
To defy him when you're this weak
And this spacey

So what are you going to do about it
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Advice and religion, you can't take it
You can't seem to believe it
The peacock is afraid to parade
You're under the thumb of the maid
You really can't give love in this condition
Still you know how you need it

They open and close you
Then they talk like they know you
They don't know you
They're friends and they're foes too
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu
So why does it come as such a shock
To know you really have no one
Only a river of changing faces
Looking for an ocean
They trickle through your leaky plans
Another dream over the dam
And you're lying in some room
Feeling like your right to be human
Is going over too
Well, some are gonna knock you
And some'll try and clock you
You know it's really hard to talk sense to you
Trouble child

159,Joni Mitchell,Just Like This Train,"I'm always running behind the time
Just like this train
Shaking into town
With the brakes complaining
I used to count lovers like railroad cars
I counted them on my side
Lately I don't count on nothing
I just let things slide

The station master's shuffling cards
Boxcars are banging in the yards
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you lost your heart

I went looking for a cause
Or a strong cat without claws
Or any reason to resume
And I found this empty seat
In this crowded waiting room
Everybody waiting
Old man sleeping on his bags
Women with that teased up kind of hair
Kids with the jitters in their legs
And those wide, wide open stares
And the kids got Cokes and chocolate bars
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you've lost your heart

What are you going to do now
You've got no one
To give your love to

Well I've got this berth and this pull down blind
I've got this fold up sink
And these rocks and these cactuses going by
And a bottle of German wine to drink
Settle down into the clickety clack
With the clouds and the stars to read
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have
Watching your hairline recede, my vain darling

Watching your hair and clouds and stars
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car
This jealous lovin's bound to make me crazy
I can't find my goodness
I lost my heart
Oh, sour grapes because I lost my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
160,Joni Mitchell,I Think I Understand,"Daylight falls upon the path, the forest falls behind
Today I am not prey to dark uncertainty
The shadow trembles in its wrath, I've robbed its blackness blind
And tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to me

I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

Now the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chime
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones and sinking sand

Sometime voices in the night will call me back again
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time
Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
161,Joni Mitchell,Black Crow,"There's a crow flying
Black and ragged
Tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky

I took a ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How'm I ever going to know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue blue sky

In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
And diving diving diving diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky
I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window
And I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying
In a blue sky
Oh I'm like a black crow flying

162,Joni Mitchell,Blue Boy,"Lady called the blue boy, love
She took him home
Made himself an idol, yes
So he turned to stone
Like a pilgrim she travelled
To place her flowers
Before his granite grace
And she prayed aloud for love
To waken in his face
In his face, oh

Sometimes in the evening
He would read to her
Roll her in his arms
And give his seed to her
She would wake in the morning
Without him
And go to the window
And look out through the pane
But the statue in her garden
He always looked the same
He looked the same, ah

Bring her boots of leather
And she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan
She'll glance for him
Here he comes after midnight
To find her again
He will come few times more
Till he finds a lady statue
Standing in a door

163,Joni Mitchell,Marcie,"Marcie in a coat of flowers
Steps inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye

Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from the river there's no one to take her
To the sea

Marcie dresses warm its snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how
He tells her
Wait for me
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket

164,Joni Mitchell,Song to a Seagull,"Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

Out of the city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach
Out of cry
I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach
Out of cryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in
In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten toEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
166,Joni Mitchell,The Arrangement,"You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

While you still have the time you could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind
Is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whisky bars
No one cares who you really are

You're the keeper of the cards
Yes I know it gets hard
Keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be
A part of the arrangement

You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some room trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
167,Joni Mitchell,Shades of Scarlett Conquering,"Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
Mimicking tenderness she sees
In sentimental movies
A celluloid rider comes to town
Cinematic lovers sway
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
Take her breath away

Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair
She comes from a school of southern charm
She likes to have things her way
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Would soon be made to pay
Friends have told her not so proud
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling ""not so loud""

Lovers in anger ""block of ice""
Harder and harder just to be nice
Given in the night to dark dreams
From the dark things she feels
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
Running from the reels
Beauty and madness to be praised
'cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood-red fingernails

Out of the fire and still smoldering
She says ""a woman must have everything""
Shades of scarlett conquering
She says ""a woman must have everything""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
168,Joni Mitchell,Judgement of the Moon and Stars (Ludwig’s Tune),"No tongue in the bell
And the fishwives yell
But they might as well be mute
So you get to keep the pictures
That don't seem like much
Cold white keys under your fingers
Now you're thinking
""That's no substitute
It just don't do it
Like the song of a warm warm body
Loving your touch""

In the court they carve your legend
With an apple in its jaw
And the women that you wanted
They get their laughs
Long silk stockings
On the bedposts of refinement
You're too raw
They think you're too raw
It's the judgement of the moon and stars
Your solitary path
Draw yourself a bath
Think what you'd like to have
For supper
Or take a walk
A park
A bridge
A tree
A river
Revoked but not yet cancelled
The gift goes on
In silence
In a bell jar
Still a song
You've got to shake your fists at lightning now
You've got to roar like forest fire
You've got to spread your light like blazes
All across the sky
They're going to aim the hoses on you
Show 'em you won't expire
Not till you burn up every passion
Not even when you die
Come on now
You've got to try
If you're feeling contempt
Well then you tell it
If you're tired of the silent night
Jesus well then you yell it
Condemned to wires and hammers
Strike every chord that you feel
That broken trees
And elephant ivories concealEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
169,Joni Mitchell,The Dawntreader,"Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
The roll of the harbour wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes
And he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his seadreams come to me

City satins left at home I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down till the rain delights you
You do not hide
Sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his seadreams come to me
Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the grey sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his seadreams come to me
All his seadreams come to meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
170,Joni Mitchell,The Fiddle and the Drum,"And so once again
My dear Johnny my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say I have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember
All the good things you are
And so I ask you please
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Oh, my friend
What time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist

And so once again
Oh, America my friend
And so once again
You are fighting us all
And when we ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum
You say we have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember
All the good things you are
And so we ask you please
Can we help you find the peace and the star

To fear the beating of your drumEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
171,Joni Mitchell,Banquet,"Come to the dinner gong
The table is laden high
Fat bellies and hungry little ones
Tuck your napkins in
And take your share
Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare

I took my share down by the sea
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide
Seagulls come down
And they squawk at me
Down where the water-skiers glide

Some turn to Jesus
And some turn to heroin
Some turn to rambling round
Looking for a clean sky
And a drinking stream
Some watch the paint peel off
Some watch their kids grow up
Some watch their stocks and bonds
Waiting for that big deal
American Dream
I took my dream down by the sea
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
And logs and sails
And Shell Oil pails
Dogs and tugs and summertime
Back in the banquet line
Angry young people crying

Who let the greedy in
And who left the needy out
Who made this salty soup
Tell him we're very hungry now
For a sweeter fare
In the cookie I read
""Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
172,Joni Mitchell,Urge For Going,"I awoke today and found the frost
Perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it
Gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold and all
The trees are shivering in a naked row
I get the urge for going
But I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
Is closing in
I had me a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town
My darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground
Bully winds came around, pushed them face
Down in the snow
He got the urge for going
And I had to let him go
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown
Summertime was falling down and winter
Was closing in
Now the warriors of winter they gave a
Cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that
Lives is getting out
See the geese in chevron flight flapping
And racing on before the snow
They got the urge for going
And they got the wings so they can go
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
Is closing in
I'll ply the fire with kindling now
I'll pull the blankets up to my chin
I""ll lock the vagrant winter out and
I'll fold my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
Have her stay for just another
Month or so
But she's got the urge for gong
So I guess she'll have to go
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
All her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
173,Joni Mitchell,Sweet Bird,"Out on some borderline
Some mark of in between
I lay down golden-in time
And woke up vanishing

Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time
You must be laughing
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change
You must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing

Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power, ideals and beauty
Fading in everyone's hand

Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine
Out here on this horizon line
With the earth spinning
And the sky forever rushing
No one knows
They can never get that close
Guesses at most
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching

174,Joni Mitchell,The Priest,"The priest sat in the airport bar
He was wearing his father's tie
And his eyes looked into my eyes so far
Whenever the words ran dry
Behind the lash and the circles blue
He looked as only a priest can: through
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you
And my eyes said, ""Let us try""

He said, ""You wouldn't like it here
No, it's no place you should share
The roof is ripped with hurricanes
And the room is always bare
I need the wind and I seek the cold""
He reached past the wine for my hand to hold
And he saw me young, and he saw me old
And he saw me sitting there

Then he took his contradictions out
And he splashed them on my brow
So which words was I then to doubt
When choosing what to vow
Should I choose them all-should I make them mine
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines
And he asked for truth and he asked for time
And he asked for only now
Now the trials are trumpet scored
Oh will we pass the test
Or just as one loves more and more
Will one love less and less
Oh come let's run from this ring we're in
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin
Saying let them lose, crying let them win
"
175,Joni Mitchell,Night in the City,"Light up light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up nights up
Takin' the town by surprise
Night time night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from and places to go

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

Take off take off
Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway stairway
Down to the crowds in the street
They go their way
Looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
176,Joni Mitchell,Lesson in Survival,"Lesson in Survival
Spinning out on turns
That gets you tough
Guru books-the Bible
Only a reminder
That you're just not good enough
You need to believe in something
Once I could in our love
Black road
Double yellow line
Friends and kin
Campers in the kitchen
That's fine sometimes
But I know my needs
My sweet tumbleweed
I need more quiet times
By a river flowing
You and me
Deep kisses
And the sun going down

Maybe it's paranoia
Maybe it's sensitivity
Your friends protect you
Scrutinize me
I get so damn timid
Not at all the spirit
That's inside of me
Oh baby I can't seem to make it
With you socially
There's this reef around me
I'm looking way out at the ocean
Love to see that green water in motion
I'm going to get a boat
And we can row it
If you ever get the notion
To be needed by me
Fresh salmon frying
And the tide rolling in
I went to see a friend tonight
'Was very late when I walked in
My talking as it rambled
Revealed suspicious reasoning
The visit seemed to darken him
I came in as bright
As a neon light
And I burned out
Right there before him
I told him these things
I'm telling you now
Watched them buckle up
In his brow
When you dig down deep
You lose good sleep
And it makes you
Heavy company
I will always love you
Hands alike
Magnet and iron
The soulsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
177,Joni Mitchell,Talk To Me,"There was a moon and a street lamp
I didn't know I drank such a lot
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda
The full length of the parking lot!
Oh, I talk too loose
Again I talk too open and free
I pay a high price for my open talking
Like you do for your silent mystery
Come and talk to me
Please talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Mr. Mystery
We could talk about Martha
We could talk about landscapes
I'm not above gossip
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!
Or we could talk about power
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies
Or Bergman's nordic blues
Please just talk to me
Any old theme you choose
Just come and talk to me
Mr. Mystery, talk to me
You could talk like a fool-I'd listen
You could talk like a sage
Anyway the best of my mind
All goes down on the strings and the page
That mind picks up all these pictures
It still gets my feet up to dance
Even though it's covered with keyloids
From the ""slings and arrows of outrageous romance""
I stole that from Willy the Shake!
You know--""Neither a borrower nor a lender be""
Romeo, Romeo talk to me!
Is your silence that golden?
Are you comfortable in it?
Is it the key to your freedom
Or is it the bars on your prison?
Are you gagged by your ribbons?
Are you really exclusive or just miserly?
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!
Come and spend some on me--
Shut me up and talk to me!
I'm always talking!
Chicken squawking!
"
178,Joni Mitchell,Shadows and Light,"Every picture has its shadows
And it has some source of light
Blindness, blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors
The blessings of parasites
Blindness, blindness and sight
Threatened by all things
Devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things
Devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness, blindness and sight

Suntans in reservation dining rooms
Pale miners in their lantern rays
Night, night and day
Hostage smile on presidents
Freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night, night and day
Threatened by all things
God of cruelty
Drawn to all things
God of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day, day and night
Critics of all expression
Judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards
Or some ideals we fight
For wrong, wrong and right
Threatened by all things
Man of cruelty - mark of Cain
Drawn to all things
Man of delight - born again, born again
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Wrong and rightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
179,Joni Mitchell,Blonde in the Bleachers,"The blonde in the bleachers
She flips her hair for you
Above the loudspeakers
You start to fall
She follows you home
But you miss living alone
You can still hear sweet mysteries
Calling you
The bands and the roadies
Lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em
It's pleasure to try 'em
It's trouble to keep 'em
'Cause it seems like you've gotta give up
Such a piece of your soul
When you give up the chase
Feeling it hot and cold
You're in rock 'n' roll
It's the nature of the race
It's the unknown child
So sweet and wild
It's youth
It's too good to waste

She tapes her regrets
To the microphone stand
She says, ""You can't hold the hand
Of a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Or count on your plans
With a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Compete with the fans
For your rock 'n' roll man
For very long
The girls and the bands
And the rock 'n' roll man""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
180,Joni Mitchell,Let the Wind Carry Me,"Papa's faith is people
Mama she believes in cleaning
Papa's faith is in people
Mama she's always cleaning
Papa brought home the sugar
Mama taught me the deeper meaning
She don't like my kick pleat skirt
She don't like my eyelids painted green
She don't like me staying up late
In my high-heeled shoes
Living for that Rock'n'Roll dancing scene
Papa says ""Leave the girl alone, Mother
She's looking like a Movie Queen""

Mama thinks she spoilt me
Papa knows somehow he set me free
Mama thinks she spoilt me rotten
She blames herself
But papa he blesses me
It's a rough road to travel
Mama let go now
It's always called for me
Sometimes I get that feeling
And I want to settle
And raise a child up with somebody
I get that strong longing
And I want to settle
And raise a child up with somebody
But it passes like the summer
I'm a wild seed again

181,Joni Mitchell,See You Sometime,"Where are you now
Are you in some hotel room
Does it have a view?
Are you caught in a crowd
Or holding some honey
Who came on to you?
Why do you have to be so jive
Ok hang up the phone
It hurts
But something survives
Though it's undermined
I'd still like to see you sometime

I'm feeling so good
And my friends all tell me
That I'm looking fine
I run in the woods
I spring from the boulders
Like a mama lion
I'm not ready to
Change my name again
But you know I'm not after
A piece of your fortune
And your fame
Cause I tasted mine
I'd just like to see you sometime
Pack your suspenders
I'll come meet your plane
No need to surrender
I just want to see you again

We're in for more rain
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees
It seems such a shame
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly
I couldn't take them all on then
With a headful of questions and hypes
So when the hopes got so slim
I just resigned
But I'd still like to see you sometime
I'd sure like to see youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
182,Joni Mitchell,Chinese Café/Unchained Melody,"Caught in the middle
Carol, we're middle class
We're middle aged
We were wild in the old days
Birth of rock n' roll days
Now your kids are coming up straight
My child's a stranger, I bore her
But I could not raise her
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

Down at the Chinese Café
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing, ""Oh my love, my darling""
One more time

Uranium money
Is booming in the old home town now
It's putting up sleek concrete
Tearing the old landmarks down now
Paving over brave little parks
Ripping off Indian land again
How long, how long
Short-sighted business man
Ah nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Down at the Chinese Café
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing, ""You give your love so sweetly""
One more time

Christmas is sparkling
Out on Carol's lawn
This girl of my childhood games
With kids nearly grown and gone
Grown so fast
Like the turn of a page
We look like our mothers did now
When we were those kids' age
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

Down at the Chinese Café
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing, ""Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me""

I wonder where the time goes)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
183,Joni Mitchell,The Magdalene Laundries,"I was an unmarried girl
I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters
For the way men looked at me
Branded as a jezebel
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame
Into the Magdalene Laundries

Most girls come here pregnant
Some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly by her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow
All of us woe-begotten daughters
In the streaming stains
Of the Magdalene Laundries

Prostitutes and destitutes
And temptresses like me
Fallen women
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery
Why do they call this heartless place
Our Lady of Charity?
Oh charity!
These bloodless brides of Jesus
If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
Concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon
They leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain
At the Magdalene Laundries

Peg O'Connell died today
She was a cheeky girl
A flirt
They just stuffed her in a hole!
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!
One day I'm going to die here too
And they'll plant me in the dirt
Like some lame bulb
That never blooms come any spring
Not any spring
No, not any spring

184,Joni Mitchell,Barangrill,"Three waitresses all wearing
Black diamond earrings
Talking about zombies
And Singapore slings
No trouble in their faces
Not one anxious voice
None of the crazy you get
From too much choice
The thumb and the satchel
Or the rented Rolls-Royce
And you think she knows something
By the second refill
You think she's enlightened
As she totals your bill
You say ""Show me the way
To Barangrill""

Well some say it's in service
They say ""Humble Makes Pure""
You're hoping it's near Folly
'Cause you're headed that way for sure
And you just have to laugh
'Cause it's all so crazy
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend
And eggs over easy
It's just a trick on you
Her mirrors and your will
So you ask the truck driver
On the way to the till
But he's just a slave
To Barangrill
The guy at the gaspumps
He's got a lot of soul
He sings Merry Christmas for you
Just like Nat King Cole
And he makes up his own tune
Right on the spot
About whitewalls and windshields
And this job he's got
And you want to get moving
And you want to stay still
But lost in the moment
Some longing gets filled
And you even forget to ask
""Hey, Where's Barangrill?""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
185,Joni Mitchell,Come In From the Cold,"Back in 1957
We had to dance a foot apart
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
Holding their rulers without a heart
And so with just a touch of our fingers
Ah, it could make our circuitry explode
All we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in) Come in
Come in from the cold (come in)
We were so young
Oh come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

We really thought we had a purpose
We were so anxious to achieve
We had hope
The world held promise
For a slave to liberty
Freely I slaved away for something better
And I was bought and sold
And all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
We were so sure
Oh come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I feel your legs under the table
Leaning into mine
I feel renewed
I feel disabled
By these bonfires in my spine
I don't know who the arsonist was
Which incendiary soul
But all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
You were too warm
Oh come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
I am not some stone commission
Like a statue in a park
I am flesh and blood and vision
I am howling in the dark
Long blue shadows of the jackals
Are falling on a pay phone by the road
Oh, all they ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
I was so low
Oh come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

Is this just vulgar electricity
Is this the edifying fire
It was so pure
Does your smile's covert complicity
Debase as it admires
Just a flu with a temperature
Are you just checking out your mojo
Or am I just fighting off growing old
Just a high fever
All I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
It was so pure
Please come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I know we never will be perfect
Never entirely clear
When the moon shines
We get hurt and we just panic
And we strike out
Out of fear
You were only being kind
I fear the sentence of this solitude
Two hundred years on hold
For my loving crime
Oh and all we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in) Come in
Come in from the cold (come in)
When the moon shines
Oh come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

When I thought life had some meaning
When I thought I'd had some choice
I was running blind
And I made some value judgments
In a self-important voice
I was outta' line, outta line
But then absurdity came over me
And I longed to lose control
Into no mind
Oh all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
You were so kind
Please come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
Oh Come in come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
Oh Come in come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
Please come in
(Come in, come in, come in)

186,Joni Mitchell,Songs to Aging Children Come,"Through the windless wells of wonder
By the throbbing light machine
In a tea leaf trance or under
Orders from the king and queen

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

People hurry by so quickly
Don't they hear the melodies
In the chiming and the clicking
And the laughing harmonies

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Some come dark and strange like dying
Crows and ravens whistling
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
So much said in listening
Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Does the moon play only silver
When it strums the galaxy
Dying roses will they will their
Perfumed rhapsodies to me

187,Joni Mitchell,Electricity,"The Minus is loveless
He talks to the land
And the leaves fall
And the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, Plus
She don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

The masking tape tangles
It's sticky and black
And the copper
Proud headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges
That don't get charged back
Well the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy
And she holds out her flashlight
And she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her
What the trouble might be
Well I'm learning
It's peaceful
With a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown
Of this century
They're not going to fix it up
Too easy
We once loved-together
And we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded
And the sparks started flying
And the loose wires
Were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up
Too easy
But she holds out her candle
And she shines it in
And she begs him to show her
How to fix it again
While the song that he sang her
To soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits
Like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up
Too easyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
188,Joni Mitchell,The Dry Cleaner From Des Moines,"I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise
I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'Cause every time, I dropped a dime, I blew it
He kept ringing bells, nothing to it
He got three oranges, three lemons, three cherries, three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck, it's just luck
You get a little lucky and you make a little money
I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room with their big balloons
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears and lions, pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there
It's all luck, it's just luck
Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell in some ways
Since I lost every dime I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John and get twenty for one, it's just luck
Lucky, lucky, so lucky, real lucky
That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
That cat's got luck
Really lucky (Lucky)
Lucky
(Lucky, lucky)
Lucky
Lucky (Lucky, lucky)
Lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky (Lucky)
Lucky
(Lucky, lucky)
Lucky, lucky

189,Joni Mitchell,Slouching Towards Bethlehem,"Turning and turning
Within the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart
The centre cannot hold
And a blood dimmed tide
Is loosed upon the world

Nothing is sacred
The ceremony sinks
Innocence is drowned
In anarchy
The best lack conviction
Given some time to think
And the worst are full of passion
Without mercy

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Hoping and hoping
As if with my weak faith
The spirit of this world
Would heal and rise
Vast are the shadows
That straddle and strafe
And struggle in the darkness
Troubling my eyes

Shaped like a lion
It has the head of a man
With a gaze as blank
And pitiless as the sun
As it's moving its slow thighs
Across the desert sands
Through dark indignant
Reeling falcons

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Head of a man, shape of a lion
Raging and raging
It rises from the deep
Opening its eyes
After twenty centuries
Vexed to a nightmare
Out of a stony sleep
By a rocking cradle
By the Sea of Galilee

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Head of a man, shape of a lionEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
190,Joni Mitchell,Goodbye Pork Pie Hat [Shadows and Light],"When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chittlins'
When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street!
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely!
Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on!
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down
We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says ""Pork Pie Hat Bar""
And there's black babies dancing...
Tonight!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
191,Joni Mitchell,Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter,"I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter
I came out two days on your tail
Those two bald-headed days in November
Before the first snowflakes sail
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery
A split tongue spirit talks
Noble as a nickel chief
Striking up an old juke box
And he says:
""Snakes along the railroad tracks.""
He says, ""Eagles in jet trails ...""
He says, ""Coils around feathers and talons on scales ...
Gravel under the belly plates ...""
He says, ""Wind in the Wings ...""
He says, ""Big bird dragging its tail in the dust ...
Snake kite flying on a string.""
I come from open prairie
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive!
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas
Reran on channel five
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul
I nearly broke down and cried
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me
He says, ""Your serpent cannot be denied.""
Our serpents love the whisky bars
They love the romance of the crime
But didn't I see a neon sign
Fester on your hotel blind
And a country road come off the wall
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar
And put me at the top of your danger list
Just for being so much like you are!
You're a coward against the altitude--
You're a coward against the flesh--
Coward--caught between yes and no
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!
Reckless brazen in the play
Of your changing traffic lights
Coward--slinking down the hall
To another restless night
As we center behind the eight ball
As we rock between the sheets
As we siphon the colored language
Off the farms and the streets
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America
The home of the brave and the free
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards
Of some duality
Of restless multiplicity
(Oh say can you see)
Restless for streets and honky tonks
Restless for home and routine
Restless for country-safety-and her
Restless for the likes of reckless me
Restless sweeps like fire and rain
Over virgin wilderness
It prowls like hookers and thieves
Through bolt locked tenements
Behind my bolt locked door
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me
The serpent fighting for blind desire
The eagle for clarity
What strange prizes these battles bring
These hectic joys-these weary blues
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win
Down and shaken when I think I lose
There are rivets up here in this eagle
There are box cars down there on your snake
And we are twins of spirit
No matter which route home we take
Or what we forsake
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity
And we'll go down to the beads of guile
There is danger and education
In living out such a reckless life style
I touched you on the central plains
It was plane to train my twin
It was just plane shadow to train shadow
But to me it was skin to skin
The spirit talks in spectrums
He talks to mother earth to father sky
Self indulgence to self denial
Man to woman
Scales to feathers
You and I
Eagles in the sky
You and I
Snakes in the grass
You and I
Crawl and fly
"
192,Joni Mitchell,Nathan La Franeer,"I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Through the buyers and the sellers
Through the burglar bells and the wishing wells
With gangs and girly shows
The ghostly garden grows

The cars and buses bustled thru the bedlam of the day
I looked through window-glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated through chrome-plate
The clock struck slowly half-past-noon
Through the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees
With parks and plastic clothes
The ghostly garden grows

He asked me for a dollar more
He cursed me to my face
He hated everyone who paid to ride
And share his common space
I picked my bags up from the curb
And stumbled to the door
Another man reached out his hand
Another hand reached out for more
And I filled it full of silver
And I left the fingers counting
And the sky goes on forever
Without meter maids and peace parades
You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows
You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden growsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
193,Joni Mitchell,Sisotowbell Lane,"Sisotowbell Lane
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill
Jovial neighbours come down when they will
With stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do
Our tongues turn blue

Sisotowbell Lane
Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing
Everyday in everyway
Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes we always try
We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do
We like the view
Sisotowbell Lane
Go to the city you'll come back again
To wade through the grain
You always do
Yes we always do
Come back to the stars
Sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car
We always do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
194,Joni Mitchell,The Sire of Sorrow (Job’s Sad Song),"Let me speak, let me spit out my bitterness
Born of grief and nights without sleep and festering flesh
Do you have eyes?
Can you see like mankind sees?
Why have you soured and curdled me?

Oh you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread
And everything I fear
Come true?

Once I was blessed
I was awaited like the rain
Like eyes for the blind
Like feet for the lame
Kings heard my words
And they sought out my company
But now the janitors of Shadowland flick their brooms at me

Oh you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread
And everything I fear
Come true?
(Man is the sire of sorrow)
I've lost all taste for life
I'm all complaints
Tell me why do you starve the faithful?
Why do you crucify the saints?
And you let the wicked prosper
You let their children frisk like deer
And my loves are dead or dying, or they don't come near
(We don't despise your chastening
God is correcting you)
Oh and look who comes to counsel my deep distress
Oh, these pompous physicians
What carelessness!
(Oh all this ranting, all this wind
Filling our ears with trash)
Breathtaking ignorance adding insult to injury!
They come blaming and shaming
(Evil doer)
And shattering me
(This vain man wishes to seem wise
A man born of asses)

Oh you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread
And everything I fear
Come true?
Already on a bed of sighs and screams
And still you torture me with visions
You give me terrifying dreams!
Better I was carried from the womb straight to the grave
I see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades
(Man is the sire of sorrow
Sure as the sparks ascend)
Where is hope while you're wondering what went wrong?
Why give me light and then this dark without a dawn?
( Evil is sweet in your mouth
Hiding under your tongue)
Show your face
(What a long fall from grace)
Help me understand
What is the reason for your heavy hand?
(You're stumbling in shadows
You have no name now)
Was it the sins of my youth?

What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?
(Oh your guilt must weigh so greatly)
Everything I dread and everything I fear come true
(Man is the sire of sorrow)
Oh you make everything I dread and everything I fear come trueEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
195,Joni Mitchell,Paprika Plains,"It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make-up mirror
Liquid soap and grass
And Jungle Gardenia crash
On Pine-Sol and beer ...
It's stifling in here ...
I've got to get some air ...
I'm going outside to get some air
Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down!
They're such sky oriented people--
Geared to changing weather ...
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off
I'm floating off in time
When I was three feet tall
And wide eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's General Store
All in their beaded leathers
I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war ...
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum
I'd beat the drum like war
But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed--on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off
I'm floating into my dreams
I dream paprika plains
Vast and bleak and God forsaken
Paprika plains
And a turquoise river snaking
(Where crows gaze--vigilant on wires
Where cattle graze the grasses
Far from the digits of business hours
The moon clock wanes and waxes--
But here all time is stripped away
Nowhere on these plains
Is a sprout or an egg in evidence
To measure loss or gain ...
Only a little Indian band
Come down from some windy mesa
No women to make them food and child
No expressions on their faces
I'm low in a helicopter
And the wind from whirling blades
Flaps their woven blankets
And flags their raven braids
How came they to this emptiness?
How came they to this dream?
How came I to this view
From a flying machine
Of earth and air and water
And a band of Indian men
Without herds or flocks or crops
Or families or fires to tend?
Like a phoenix up from ashes now
A blanket figure springs
With a fist raised up to turquoise skies
Like liberty
And at the point of vanishing
Where the sky and the earth meet
A bomb blooms
Deadly mushroom
White
Gold
Heat
Like a phoenix up from ashes
Up from violent mysteries
And growing 'till the giant blast
Is to it like a golfer's tee
There comes a child's beach ball
And memory takes me back
To the beach to toss it up
To the garage to get it patched
A pink and yellow beach ball
Rolling
Grand
Detached
Turning the blues and greens of earth
From space probe photographs
I float out of the hovercraft
Naked as infancy
And weightless
And drifting
Horizontally
Like a filing to a magnet
Like the long descent of rain
I am drawn
I fall against the ball
And lose paprika plains
I suckle at my mother's breast
I embrace my mother earth
I remember perforated blinds
Over the crib of my birth
And just as Eve succumbed
To reckless curiosity
I take my sharpest fingernail
And slash the globe to see
Below me--
Vast Paprika plains
And the snake the river traces
And a little band of Indian men
With no expressions on their faces.)
The rain retreats
Like troops to fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor
I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire
From J&B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back
I'm coming back for more!
The band plugs in again
You see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights
And spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back
I'm floating back to you!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
196,Joni Mitchell,The Pirate of Penance,"The pirate anchored on a Wednesday
And why he came to port I wonder
To see a lady so my friends say
She dances for the sailors
In a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbour town
I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss
He'll steal your heart and sail away
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam
Of a broken promise in the bay
Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus
He came again to see her
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday
Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us
I was at sea then

I didn't see them
I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last
The one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year
There was a time when he would
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace
Then came another ""goodbye"" and another ""Please don't go""
And he would hold me close
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace
All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow
I was at sea I tell you I was
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place
Searching for sails that don't come
And I guess but I don't know
Go ask the dancer
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't knowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
197,Joni Mitchell,Night Ride Home,"Once in a while
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home

Hula girls
And caterpillar tractors in the sand
The ukulele man
The fireworks
This 4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the overkill
Far from the overload

Back at the bar
The band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver powerlines
Gleam
On this 4th of July
Night ride home
Round the curve
And a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside
Rev for stride
4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the undertow
Far from the overload

Once in awhile
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July

198,Joni Mitchell,God Must Be a Boogie Man,"He is three
One's in the middle unmoved
Waiting
To show what he sees
To the other two
To the one attacking--so afraid
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust
And getting himself betrayed
In the plan--oh
The divine plan
God must be a boogie man!
One's so sweet
So overly loving and gentle
He lets people in
To his innermost sacred temple
Blind faith to care
Blind rage to kill
Why'd he let them talk him down
To cheap work and cheap thrills
In the plan--oh
The insulting plan
God must be a boogie man!
Which would it be
Mingus one or two or three
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see
Well, world opinion's not a lot of help
When a man's only trying to find out
How to feel about himself!
In the plan-oh
The cock-eyed plan
God must be a boogie man!
