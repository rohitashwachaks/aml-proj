"Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems"
"Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon"

"Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased"
"Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me"
Cause Im not as hard as I make it seem to be
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
Cause aint nobody feels the way that I feel when Im alone
So if I said that I wont call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
"If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)"
If we just went on (Un jour cest toi quon laissera)
"If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)"

Happiness exists when you dont know a thing
So I hope you dont think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby Im a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
Cause aint nobody feels the way that I feel when Im alone
So if I said that I wont call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star

Im fucking gone right now
Im fucking gone right now
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
"Skys getting cold, were flying from the north"
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the hoin
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like Im split life living
Let the world listen
If a haters caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
"Yeah, we still tippin"
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money she be folding"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"
"Girl, put in work"
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when Im over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder Ima drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas aint talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money she be folding"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"

Shell feel it in the morning
Aint the kind of girl youll be seeing in the morning
"Too damn raw, aint no nigga with her rollin"
Aint no nigga that she holding
"Man, her love is too damn foreign"
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money she be folding"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work"

You look so happy when Im not with you
"But then you saw me, caught you by surprise"
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I dont know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You couldve asked me why I broke your heart
You couldve told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasnt there
And just pretended like you didnt care
I dont know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
"Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine"
And now you wont love me for a second time
"I dont know why I run away, oh, girl"
"Said, I make you cry when I run away"
"Girl, take me back cause I wanna stay"
Save your tears for another
I realize that Im much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

"Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas"
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous (oh!)
Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
"Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like Im dyin"
"Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher"
Only time you see mes when Im balling with my niggas

To seein the whole world in just months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
"Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up"

And I cant stand talkin to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin to pop

In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (Mean it)
"When I tell you youre the one that was on my mind, oh"
"When its said, when its done, yeah"
I would never let you know (Let you know)
"Im ashamed of what Ive done, yeah"
When I look at you
In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see theres something burning inside you (Inside you)
"Oh, inside you (Oh, inside you)"
"I know it hurts to smile, but you try to (But you try to)"
"Oh, you try to (You try to)"
"You always try to hide the pain (Oh, oh)"
"You always know just what to say (Oh, dear)"
I always look the other way
"Im blind, Im blind"
"You lie, but I dont let it define you (Hey)"
I see theres something burning inside you
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
"Im blind, Im blind"
"You lie, but I dont let it define you"
"No, no, no, no, no-no"
"No, no, no, no, no-no"
Light a blunt up with the flame
Put that cocaine on a plate
Molly with the purple rain
Cause I lost my faith
"So I cut away the pain, uh"
Got it swimming in my veins
"Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh"
Cause I lost my faith
And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
"Well, I feel everything"
When Im coming down is the most I feel alone
"Ive been sober for a year, now its time for me"
"To go back to my old ways, dont you cry for me"
"Thought Id be a better man, but I lied to me and to you"
I take half a Xan and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heavens gate
"I tried to love, but you know Id never stay"
"But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me"
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while Im smilin
And if you know me
"When I go missing, you know where to find me"
Driving down the boulevard is blindin
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I feel everything from my body to my soul
"Girl, I feel everything"
When Im coming down is the most I feel alone
I lost my faith
Im losing my religion every day
"Time hasnt been kind to me, I pray"
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
"Oh, someone I love"
Im losing my religion every day
"Time hasnt been kind to me, I pray"
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
"Oh, someone I love"
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
This house is not a home to you
"But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down"
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate
"I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong"
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
"Hey there, lonely girl"
Did you have to tell your friends
About the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low
"I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong"
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Baby if I knew you’d be living in my sheets
I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you don’t belong
You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
"I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong"
"I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong"
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
"I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong"
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
"Girl, if your man call your phone again"
I used to pray when I was sixteen
"If I didnt make it, then Id probably make my wrist bleed"
"Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams"
Whole squad mobbin even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
"I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie"
"Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets"
You couldnt find me like Im Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Couldnt even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
"Leaving, leaving into the night"
"Now a nigga leaving, leaving"
"Leaving into the night, oh"
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
"Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick"
"She never need a man, she what a man need"
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple Ms like I was Shady
Now Im in Tribeca like Im Jay-Z
Rockin Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin dirty like Im Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee

"And for that money, I been fiending"
"Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving"
"Leaving, leaving into the night"
"Now a nigga leaving, leaving"
"Leaving into the night, oh"
"Twenty mill mansion, never lived in it"
"Zero edge pool, never dipped in it"
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing Im phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
"So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night"
"Now a nigga leaving, leaving"
"Ive been mixin, Ive been sippin"
"Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl"

The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin in the club
"We be all night, love, baby, love"

"Shouldve never put us on, bitch Im only"
"And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin"
"Everybody makin money, we dont need to kick it"

"Did an album just to do it, droppin albums like a pill"
"Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed"
"Faded for a week, I dont sleep, fuck my enemies"
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
"Everything I do, fake niggas always copy"
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
"And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand"
"Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers"
"I woke up in the mornin, models passed out in the shower"
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"""How the hell did this shit happen?"""
"Oh baby, drunk in love"
"We be all night, love, oh yeah, love"
"We be all night, love, oh yeah, love"
"Oh (Woah), oh (Woah)"
They say my brain meltin

"You can see for yourself, little lady"
"Girl, I lit a little something"
"Something something, for you"
Theres enough to pass around
"Yeah, yeah, yea yea yea yea"
"Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it"
"Baby, touch your body, body"
"You gotta taste it, feel it, Ive been on it baby"
"Dont you worry, dont you worry, you gotta keep up"
Cause Ive been gone
"Ive been gone, Ive been gone, Ive been gone"
"Ive been gone, Ive been gone"
"Ive been gone, Ive been gone, Ive been gone"
Hope I make it home
Youll be thinking of it
"I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight"
Watch us rock it out
Watch us leave the ground
After the show is done
You can take me to yours
But my lungs so muddy
I love the way it tastes
Drink it till Im ugly baby
Fuck me while Im faded
Feel that through my denims
"Baby girl, I gotcha"
Im only so I do it when I wanna
"Gone from the codeine, methazine, lean"
Got me feelin kinda weak
And its kinda hard to breathe
"But youre turning 23, so Ill fuck you if you need"
In your birthday suit
"Ima give you what you fiend, oh"
But I aint taking off my black boots
Cause Im numb from the neck down
You wont know that I cant feel it
I can win a fuckin Oscar
By the way I fuckin hid it
And youll never fuckin know
Ill never fuckin show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
"Fast life, fuck slow"
Low life for life
"Let the meds flow, let the night flow"
"Im so gone, let these meds flow"
"Im so gone, let these meds flow"
"Im so gone, Im so gone"
"Said Im gone, gone, gone"
"When the sun comes up, youre searching for a love"
So your heart wont lead you to anyone
"When the sun goes down, I know what you become"
"You become awake, unlike the rest of us"
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
As I bid yesterday goodbye
I lay my head on a thousand beds
Its been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now Ill never see your face
But its okay I adapted anyway
Adapted to these models
Whos adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
Ill stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
"So pure, like the love thats so uncut and raw"
"And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered"
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now Ill never see your face
But its okay I adapted anyway
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
God bid yesterday goodbye
"Whoa, with a nigga like me"
"Whoa, with a nigga like me"
"She said please, mercy me, mercy me"
"Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her"
"She begged me, she gave me all her pills"
"Now my back hurts, she lost control"
"Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor"
"Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor"
She said it wont be long before she falls out of love
It wont be long before she falls out of love
"Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss"
"Dont know what this is, but it all leads to this"
Youre gonna leave her
You have deceived her
Youre just a bird
I tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you
But you never let me miss you
I thought I told you
"Im not him, Im not him"
"Look what you did, nobody forced your hand"
"And dont you fall for a nigga like me, I begged, I begged"
"Now youre pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor"
"Now youre pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor"
She said it wont be long before she falls out of love
"It wont be long, before she falls out of love"
"Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss (Oh, my love)"
"Dont know what this is, but it all leads to this"
Youre gonna leave her (If she only knew)
You have deceived her
Youre just a bird
"I let you down, I led you on"
I never thought Id be here without you
Dont let me drown inside your arms
Bad thoughts inside my mind
"When the darkness comes, youre my light, baby"
"My light, baby, my light when its dark, yeah"
"Im too high, baby, too high, baby"
"Cause I know right now, that I lost it (Hey)"
"Its way too late to save our souls, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)"
"Its way too late, were on our own (Baby, on my own)"
"I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)"
Its way too late to save my—
"I cant trust (I cant trust) where I live (Where I live) anymore (Anymore, anymore, anymore)"
"Sources say (Sources say) that were done (That were done), how would they know? (They know, cause they know, cause they know)"
"Were in Hell, its disguised as a paradise with flashing lights"
"I just wanna believe theres so much more (Hey, hey, hey)"
"Its way too late to save our souls, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)"
"Its way too late, were on our own (Baby, on my own)"
"I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)"
Its way too late to save my—
"And, ooh, I tell myself I should get over you"
"I said, ooh, I know Id rather be all over you trying, trying, but I, I just want your body"
"Riding slow on top of me, girl, on top of me"
"I want you, babe, ooh-ooh"
"Its way too late (Late) to save our souls, baby (Souls, baby, oh, oh, yeah)"
"Its way too late, were on our own (Baby, on my own)"
"I made mistakes (Mistakes), I did you wrong, baby (Oh, baby, oh, oh, yeah)"
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
Theres so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So youre somebody now
But whats a somebody in a nobody town
I dont think you even know it
So youre somebody now
But whats a somebody in a nobody town
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
Its everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin
Got you losing your mind
And I dont blame you
Its everything you know
"But I own this time, this aint new"
Now I decide when were through
"I love, you love"
"I know, you know"
"What does it mean, oh"
When your hearts already numb
Wont treat it like its personal
"No, cause its just love"
It always makes its way back around
To fall is unacceptable
Cause everything youve been through made you stronger
And every day you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how its supposed to
Depending on somebody elses wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl I make enough of it to spend
I love the way youve put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
"For me again, oh yeah"
"I love, you love"
"I know, you know"
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
"Girl, youve got it made"
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
"Now, youve got it made"
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
"Girl, youve got it made"
Because your freedom was here in this cage all along
"Oooh, how did you drain all the soul from your eyes"
"How did you teach, teach yourself how to smile"
"In a world where your dreams cant be real, no"
Every touch that you sell is a lie
"I love, you love"
"I know, you know"
"(Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
"Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)"
"The reasons I cant have you, are so easy to fix"
"I didnt really plan to, but Ima do it for thi-i-is"
"The reasons I cant have you, isnt so complicated"
"Baby, if you let me, I wont hesita-a-ate"
"All I know, all I know is this"
"All I know, all I know is this"
"All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this"
"All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this"
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
I know theres been stigma round me
I know you heard things about me
"You sleep one eye closed, too scared to get heartbroke"
"Heard too many lies told, dont make this shit my fault"
I could tell why you would doubt me
"I hit one time, you cant live without me"
"Girl Im just peakin, Im just tryna be on top of you, on top of you, ooh"
"All I know (All I know, all I know, all I)"
"All I know is this (All I know, all I know, all I)"
"All I know (All I know, all I know, all I know)"
"All I know is this (All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know)"
"All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this"
"All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this"
"Is this, is this"
"(Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
"Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
"Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
"Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
"Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
"Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)"
S-s-sleep with one eye open
Im terrified to get my heart broke
Blood talkin like a Piru
"Fuck with me, nigga, you gon die slow (Gang)"
Lamborghini make you Crip walk (Skrrt)
Im smashin off with my side ho
"Full of these medicals, bitches, got several"
She eat the dick up like its an edible
Then I get back to my capital
I got the Glock on the passenger
I got these tropical fantasies
They gon remember my legacy
Hang out the roof of the Ghost
The cash in my pocket spill right on the floor
The cash in my pocket spill out on the floor
"When the cash overflow, let the cash overflow"
I done fucked a bitch that bougie (Yeah)
"Have you ever, ever fucked a bitch that bougie? (Oh-ooh-ooh)"
I done fucked a bitch that bougie
"I done, I done, I done fucked a bitch that bougie (Oh, ooh)"

"But on Thursday, Thursday (Ooh)"
Where were you when I needed you eight months ago?
"All your girlfriends talkin bout me, now you ringin up my phone"
"I bet you miss me now baby, I bet youd kiss me now baby"
Especially since you know that this aint nothin and I only just begun
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
"Well baby, Ive been alone for almost all my life"
What makes you think that you can ever do me right
Youre the same old song
Youre the same old song
Youre the same old song

The same old song
And now Im poppin yea

The same old song
"Listen to that shit, man"
The Weeknd music make the ladies panties get wet!
Jam that shit my nigga
Im high as a motherfucker
I dont give a shit
Im going to the strip club
"Im throwing thousand dollars nigga, thousand!"
"Spend that shit nigga, its Christmas!"
The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
"Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her"
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now Im worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun
"I know you want your money, girl"
"Cause you do this every day, okay"
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
"Well, its something I relate to"
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobodys ever made me fall in love
"With this amount of touch, well"
Im not a fool
I just love that youre dead inside (That youre dead inside)
"Im not a fool, Im just lifeless too"
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could
"Ooh girl, I know I should leave you"
And learn to mistreat you
Cause you belong to the world
"And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you"
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
And I know that Im saying too much
"Even though Id rather hold my tongue, yeah"
And Ill pull you closer holding on to
"Every moment til my time is done, yeah"
"And this aint right, youve been the only one to make me smile"
"In so long, Ive succumbed to what Ive become, oh baby"
Im not a fool (Im not a fool)
I just love that youre dead inside (That youre dead inside)
"Im not a fool, (Oh no) Im just lifeless too (Im just lifeless too)"
But you taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)
When nobody ever would (When nobody ever would)
And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)
"When nobody ever could (Oh babe, oh babe)"
"Ooh girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)"
And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)
"Cause you belong to the world (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)"
"And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (Oh babe, I wanna embrace you)"
Domesticate you (Domesticate you)
But you belong to the world (Oh baby)
"You belong to the world, you belong to the world"
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
"Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world"
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream
"Ooh girl, I know I should leave you"
And learn to mistreat you
"Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah"
"And ooh girl, I want to embrace you"
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
"Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue"
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum
"Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum"
"David Carradine, Ima die when I cum"
"She just givin head, she dont know what I done"
"Like Im James Dean, Ima die when Im young"
"Die when Im young, die when Im young"
Heaven knows that Ive been told
Paid for the life that I chose
"If I could, Id trade it all"
Trade it for a halo
And she said that shell pray for me
"I said, ""Its too late for me"""
Cause I think its safe to say
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
Valhalla is where all the righteous are led
Mulhollands where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
"Cross on my neck, cross on my neck"
"Over 45, Ima drift on a bend"
"Do a buck 20, Ima fly off the edge"
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
"Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin"
She said that shell pray for me
"I said, ""Its too late for me"""
Cause I think its safe to say
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
"Angels all singin in monasteries, yeah"
My soul is burning in LaFerraris
"Father, sorry, Father, sorry"
Halos are given to ordinary lives
"No, but this aint ordinary life"
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Said you fucked another man
"Finally, I knew this day would come"
Cause I see fear in your eyes
Youve been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land youre mine
Its been exactly since Ive seen your face
Ive been living on the road
"And youve been living all alone, at home"
"Girl I hope, he made you satisfied (you did)"
Well baby I wont cry
As long as you know that when I land youre mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
There are certain things that Ive come to understand
"Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman"
"I try to master the art, of that far away love"
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now its times like this that I say to myself
"Weve been living in a cold, cold world, cold world"
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know when I land youre mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he cant make you feel this pretty
"No, he wont make you feel this beautiful"
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
(Breakdown - The Weeknd harmonizing)
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he cant make you feel this pretty
"No, he wont make you feel this beautiful"
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he cant make you feel this pretty
"No, he wont make you feel this beautiful"
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
Cest tout ce quon entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
"Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveau"

Elle nétait quune gamine à ce moment

"Girl, I been drinkin all day"
Its been a long week
Cant you tell by my face?
I wanna lose myself between your legs
I wanna make your body shake
"Girl, if you drink this fifth, no chase"
"I promise youll have nothing to say, nothing to say"

"Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah"
I forgot what it feels to regret my sins
I need that old thing back lately
You can help me out baby
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have
So I dont know what to expect from you tonight
But Im not trying to waste nobodys time
"Im just trying to find material, some inspiration"
"We can put it in a song, if you want"
But the least I deserve is no conversation

Id rather be your enemy
"Than any friend you think I would be, oh yeah"

"You lookin at my nigga, you can have him too"
"Cause baby, I aint cuffing, girl, I hope you knew"
"There aint nothin wrong, you can pick and choose"
"Just dont call tomorrow askin ""What did I do?"""
"Girl, you know what you did, all to blame is you"
Now the least I deserve is no conversation

Theres no one inside
But youre free to relax
If you commit to this ride
Theres no turning back
Youve been here before
This worlds not for us
Its not what it seems
"Youll learn to love how to dream, dream"
"Youll learn to love how to dream, dream"
Theres no need to hide
You said youve been to the sky
Well go beyond that
"Youve been here before, girl"
This worlds not for us
Its not what it seems
"Youll learn to love how to dream, dream"
"Youll learn to love how to dream, dream"
"I could teach you to dream, oooh"
Well find our love in the sky
Well find our love in the sky
Well find our love in the sky
Well find our love in the sky
Well find our love in the sky
Well find our love in the sky
How does it feel?
Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
"How does it feel, are you free?"
"As for me, Ive been getting grown"
"As for me, Ive been getting old"
"As for me, I’ve been flying around the world"
I’ve been killing these shows
But Im always getting high
Cause my confidence low
And Im always in a rush
Aint no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
Its not something I would know
But Im sure Ill make you cum
Do it three times in a row
And Im sure you would have left
Put that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control
Only losers go to school
I taught myself how to move
Im not the type to count on you
"Cause stupids next to ""I love you"""
No? So what can you show me
That my heart dont know already?
We make our own sense
And youre qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart dont know already?
We make our own sense
Only losers go to school
They cant teach what they cant prove
Come put this inside a test-tube
"Cause stupids next to ""I love you"""
So what can you show me
That my heart dont know already?
Cause we make our own sense
Youre qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart dont know already?
Cause we make our own sense
And youre qualified to-
And now that were all grown up
Who do we owe it to?
And now that weve gone this far
Who do we owe it all to?
We did it all alone
Now were coming for the throne
We did it all alone
Now were coming for the throne
And now that we all came up
Do we lose? Do we lose?
So what can you show me
That my heart dont know already?
Cause we make our own sense
And youre qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart dont know already?
Cause we make our own sense
And youre qualified to me
"I love her, today"
"Cause its Wednesday, I wont be late"
"Ooh, now I need to know"
If youre feeling when Im free
"Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday"
"Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday"
"Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday"
"But on Thursday, make sure"
"You are thirsty, oh, on Thursday, baby"
"Get ready, oh, on Thursday"
"Why you calling? Oh, on Thursday"
"Just wait on Thursday, baby"
"Girl I try, girl I try"
Ive been here for too long
"Why are you calling again? (Oh, again)"
"But its not Thursday, baby why you calling?"
"Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday"
"Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday"
"Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday But on Thursday, make sure"
"You are thirsty, oh, on Thursday, baby"
"Get ready, oh, on Thursday"
"Why you holding in, oh, on Thursday"
"Just wait on Thursday, baby"
"(Baby, I’m rushin to it til then)"
"(Girl, get ready at any time)"

You been picking my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didnt ask you
And its the most youve worked
Even though I probably dont deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
"I got show money, baby"
"I wanna show you how I blow money, baby"
"I wanna show you how I throw money, baby"
"Im a kid, so its hard for me to hold money, baby"
"Cause Im a star, dont get it twisted"
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
"Somebody pop em before we pop em all, before we pop em all"
"Saying this aint nothing, but its all I need"
And the peak aint reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I aint scared of the fall
I aint scared of the fall
I aint scared of the fall
I aint scared of the fall
Ive felt the ground before
Ive felt the ground before
Ive felt the ground before
Ive felt the ground before
Cuz I aint scared of the fall
"Mama, I understand why youre mad"
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But Ive been good since Thursday
Yes Ive been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends names Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B
My cup full of Texas
"Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it"
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
"So you aint gotta ask ""Whos next? Whos next?"""
"Saying this aint nothing, but its all I need"
And the peak aint reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I aint scared of the fall
I aint scared of the fall
I aint scared of the fall
Ive felt the ground before
Ive felt the ground before
Ive felt the ground before
And I aint scared of the fall
Ill let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used to do
"Girl, I’m open to anything thatll get you into that zone"
And understand that we’re all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
"Baby girl, you know whats in store"
And baby I will stay up all night
Ive been goin hard since last night
And Imma go harder tonight
Wish you could see you through my eyes
"Ooh, Im telling you this aint the same"
And I know hes still in your brain
Im bout to burn that shit into flames
"Once Im in you, baby"
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
Cuz baby when Im finished with ya
You wont wanna go outside
"And Imma work you like a pro, baby"
"Why, and you gon take it like one"
"Yeah, you gon take it like one"
And Imma give it like you asked for it
"Why, cuz you been talkin bout it"
I know you talkin bout it
"Ooh, baby, when Im done with you"
You aint saying nothing
"Yeah, you aint saying nothing"
"Ooh, baby, when Im done with you"
You aint saying nothing
"Yeah, you aint saying nothing"
You gon make me show off
All the pain that you feel you can tell
That we aint making no love
"But Ill pretend, oh girl, Ill pretend"
"If you pretend then, girl, Ill pretend"
Lets make it seem like were all we need in the end
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
Cuz baby when Im finished with ya
You wont wanna go outside
Lets break it down
Lets break it down
I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
"Scratching counter tops, I was screaming"
My back arched like a cat
"My position couldnt stop, you were hitting it"
"And I shouldnt cry, but I love it, star boy"
"And I shouldnt cry, but I love it (I love it), star boy"
"And I shouldnt cry, but I love it, star boy"
"And I shouldnt cry, but I love it, star boy"
"I just want to see you shine cause I know you are a star, girl"
"I just want to see you shine cause I know you are a star, girl"
"I just want to see you shine cause I know you are a star, girl"
I got something to tell you but dont know how Ima say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
"Girl, I been bad again, girl, I been bad again"
Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use em
When Im faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

"Its what Im guilty of, oh yeah"
"I cant get enough, Im insane"
"Id be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you"
"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing"
"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you"
Youll never make me stay so take your weight off of me
"I know your every move, so wont you please let me be"
Ive been here times before but I was too blind to see
"That you seduce every man, this time you wont seduce me"
"Shes saying thats ok, hey baby do what you please"
"I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
"She looked me deep in the eyes, she touchin me so to start"
"She say theres no turnin back, she trapped me in her heart"
"Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no"
"Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!"
"She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town"
Every musicians fan after the curtains come down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
"Who promise fortune and fame, a life thats so carefree"
"Shes saying thats ok, hey baby do what you want"
"Ill be your night lovin thing, Ill be the freak you can taunt"
"And I dont care what you say, I want to go too far"
Ill be your everything if you make me a star
"Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no"
"Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!"
She said I have to go home ‘cause Im real tired you see
"But I hate sleepin alone, why dont you come with me"
"I said my babys at home, shes probably worried tonight"
I didnt call on the phone to say that Im alright
"Diana walked up to me, she said Im all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone sayin baby Im alright
I said unlock the door cause I forgot the key
She said hes not coming back because hes sleeping with me
"Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no"
"Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!"
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
"Cause no one will love you, like her"
Like tears in the rain
So now that shes gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Dont show the world how alone youve become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
"Cause no one will love you, like her"
"Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)"
When its said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when its said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
Cause Ive gone too far
And I started too young
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch
They all feel the same
"Adjust to the fame, ooh"
"Cause no one will love you, like her"
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain)
So now that shes gone (Oh no)
Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Dont show the world how alone youve become (Alone youve become)
They all feel the same
I shouldve let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I couldve set you free
"I watched you stay, oh"
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
"She let it slip away, away, away"
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
"She let it slip away, away, away"
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
"She let it slip away, away, away"
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
"She let it slip away, away, away"
They all feel the same (Ooh)
"Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, baby)"
"Cause no one will love you, like her (No one could love me)"
Its pointless (No ones gonna love me)
Like tears in the rain (No one can love no more)
"So now that shes gone (Oh, now that shes gone, baby)"
"Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)"
And die with a smile
"Dont show the world how alone youve become (Im not gonna show the world) (Oh, how alone Ive become)"
"They all feel the same (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)"
"Adjust to the fame (Ohh, adjust to the fame, I aint tryin to be alone, baby)"
"Cause no one will love you, like her (No ones gonna love you no more)"
"Like tears in the rain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
"So now that shes gone (Ooh, baby) (No ones gonna love me no more)"
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Dont show the world how alone youve become (No ones gonna love me)
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
"She let it slip away, away, away"
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
I tell myself that Ill take you for the last time
Ill be over you eventually
"Time after time, you seem to brush me off"
I understand what we have become
"You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine"
I was in love with your mystery
Now Ill just take what I can get from you
Im not embarrassed to be what you want me to be
"Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide"
I dont pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call youll make when youre all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
"Well, here comes the sun"
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don’t you worry bout me talking
I know why you’ve been coming
"I’ll be quiet, this aint nothing to me"
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won’t stop until you ask me
Don’t you worry about us messing up my sheets
"Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide"
I dont pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
And know that I will be a call away
The call youll make when youre all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
"Well, here comes the sun"
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
"Well, here comes the sun"
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
"Girl, I know you so well"
"Girl, I know your routine"
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
"Girl, I know you so well"
"Girl, I know your routine"
"Well, here comes the sun"
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
"Well, here comes the sun"
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
"Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo"
"Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo"
"Baby, you were so strong"
"Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo"
"Baby, you were calm, you were so calm, yeah"
Tell me where it went wrong
"Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo"
"Tell me how to love, its been so long"
"When a calls not enough, and you just need to touch"
Thinking twice Im the one
But you just need to trust
Youre only looking for attention
You only notice it cause Im never around
"Youre only looking for attention, oh, oh"
Youre only looking for attention
The only problem is youll never get enough
"Youre only looking for attention, oh, oh"
What do you expect now?
"Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo"
Only thing left is the sex now
"Cause baby, too vexed now"
"Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo"
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When a touch not enough
You were more than a fuck
"Thinking twice, Im the one"
But you just need to trust
Youre only looking for attention
You only notice it cause Im never around
"Youre only looking for attention, oh, oh"
Youre only looking for attention
The only problem is youll never get enough
"Youre only looking for attention, oh, oh-oh"
"Ooo, ooo, ooo, attention"
"(Love all the attention, baby)"
"Ooo, ooo, ooo, attention"
"(Love all the attention, baby)"
Youre only looking for attention
You only notice it cause Im never around
"Youre only looking for attention, oh, oh"
Youre only looking for attention
The only problem is youll never get enough
"Youre only looking for attention, oh, oh-oh"
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
You did many things
"That I liked, that I liked"
And you like diamond rings
"I can provide, I can provide for you"
You made me feel so good
And you deserve your name
"On a crown, on a throne"
You did many things
"That I liked, that I liked"
And you like diamond rings
"I can provide, I can provide for you"
You made me feel so good
And you deserve your name
"On a crown, on a throne"
I havent been around my town in a long while
"I apologize, but I"
Ive been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely
But I remember on the bathroom floor
Fore I went on tour
Like you said we couldnt do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
Now Ive heard that youre single
"And uh huh, Ill give you something to live for"
You never thought youd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
Youre almost dead to him
Youre sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl its over now
And you can always count on me
"Your unshackled boy, unrestrained to touch"
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That youre always free
That youll take me in
"Now Im everything, your everything"
I bet youll take me in
I know youll take me in now
The same place I left you in (we)
I bet youll take me in
"I know youll take me in, I know youll take me in"
The same place I left you in
You did many things
"That I liked, that I liked"
And you like diamond rings
"I can provide, I can provide for you"
You made me feel so good
And you deserve your name
I got a confession to make
I dont rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
Its like a kiss was laced
"Im feein, Im feenin, Im feenin"
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays
Like a broken tape
"What you do, what you do, what you do"
Gon make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
"Material girl, anything you need"
"And Imma give it to you, to you"
"Imma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all"
"Imma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all"
Youre my number one fan
Give it to me right
Watch the diamond glow your hand
"Get you wetter than reverb, right after the dessert"
Baby youre my Dairy Queen
Watch you make my baby cream
"Lady, youre the one that I want to spend my cash on"
Spend my cash on my baby like
"Baby, just make sure that youll always put your man on"
You gon make a nigga buy a ring for your finger

"Imma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all"
Tripping over you like a crack on the floor
Cant settle with a taste
"Baby girl, give me more"
"Baby take the keys to my ride, to my home"
"Girl, Imma make it rain like a tropical storm"
Tripping over you like a crack on the floor

"I cant move, Im so paralyzed"
I cant explain why Im terrified
"Well, I dont wanna touch the sky no more"
I just wanna feel the ground when Im coming down
Its been way too long
And I dont even wanna get high no more
I just want it out of my life
"Out of my life, out"
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
Til Im bleeding out
I wanna cut you outta my mind
Til Im bleeding out
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
"Woah, Im bleeding out"
I wanna cut you outta my mind
Cause Im bleeding out
I keep telling myself I dont need it
I keep telling myself I dont need it anymore
I keep telling myself I dont need it anymore
"Yeah, people always talk about the ones that got away"
I just seem to get the ones that always want to stay
Im just too distracted with the life Im tryna paint
"(Yeah, yeah, uh, oh yeah)"
"Say, I got all these women too attracted to the fame"
Got too many niggas that will end up in the way
"Nothings gonna stop me, Ima get it either way"
"(Yeah, yeah, uh, oh yeah)"
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
We can own it
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
You dont have to spend your life with me

All she cares about is money
And the city where shes from
Her intention is the paper
She dont need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
"Well, babygirl, Im zoning"
Somebody shouldve told her
"Fuck it, I popped one"
"Oh girl, Im on one"
"Fuck it, I popped one"
"Girl, Im lying, Im on a few"

I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have
"No matter what an artists ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you"
"My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy"
"Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand"
"I usually dont like to ""spoon feed"" my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same"
The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in
The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground
The girl holding on represents you
As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence the pieces of her clothes coming off at every shot)
"The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground"
"Even though I dont want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist"
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation
"I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal"
"You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for"
Ill never make you wait again
With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to Trilogy
"Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint"

With stories of truth and stories of sin
"Yeah, the ball is in your court"
"No defense, nobodys keeping score"
No offense but Ive played this before
Maybe you can and you just dont care anymore
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldnt
You were never a good girl but youre a better woman now
"Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person"
"Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it"
But youre too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
"This time is different, you give me purpose"
"Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?"
Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like Im not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy thats thrown at me
Been thinking bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
"And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore"
We are not the same I am too reckless
Im not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And theyre about to call the wrong attention
"And I aint got no patience, no more testing"
"I do shit how I want, dont need no blessing"
XO niggas aint nothing to mess with
"Nobody stopping us, oh no were destined"
And everybody around you is so basic
"Im never rocking white, Im like a racist"
I dont drink my liquor with a chasin
And money is the only thing Im chasin
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
"Give me head all night, cum four times"
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
"Do an ounce, get some dick"

She tried to take a selfie at my Grandmas funeral
"Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems"
"Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon"
"I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke"
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
"Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices"
"Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices"
"And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices"
"They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless"
"Yeah, that shit is pointless"
"They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless"
"Yeah, that shit is pointless"

"All these squares in my pictures, yeah, we croppin those"
"Let lil shawty lick my dick, I had my boxers on"

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
"We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go"
If it aint XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
"Im like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice"
"Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy"
"Whip game, make a nigga understand though"
"Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo"

"Young, young nigga, same OG, stayin lowkey"
"Stand ten toes deep, roll fleeces"
"G says, made a thesis, Im a G"
"Im a weakness like The Weeknd, so the remix"
I beg your pardon? Its true
The rumors that they start could make us break apart
"Assumin it influenced, all this sudden change of heart"
Divorce in court and take off with the whole thing
Mind em that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel did
Like Jaden Smith Id prolly walk around all day with it
"Okay, you lame, Im a-okay with it"
Might take the whip around my old ways
Mind them that they know me

Going back in time when I feel her
"She touching me, its too familiar"
The way she doing the thang
"She does exactly the way you used to, you used to"
"Let me take a break, I need a breather"
"The way she moving, I cant believe how"
"She does exactly the same, I must be going insane, oh, oh"
Am I going crazy?
Do I need some therapy to get shorty out of my mind?
"Girl, my head is racing"
Heard shortys been needing the rest of my mind
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
"Love through her, love through her"
Thought I left that part of life behind me
Its back to haunt every girl that loves me
Why cant she leave me alone?
Cant believe every girl that I hold
"I see you, I see you"
The greatest times we had the best of
Push back rewind but I cant delete her
"Move forward into my life, I had a place and a time to apologize, to apologize"
Am I going crazy?
Do I need some therapy to get shorty out of my mind?
"Girl, my head is racing"
Heard shortys been needing the rest of my mind

"The title, ""M A N I A"", appears in bold, red capital letters"
Murphy the leopard is in the center of an arena-like area
A white light is flashing to the beat of the song
Murphy glares up as saliva dribbles from his mouth
"Abel is seen riding in his McLaren P1, singing along to the song"
There is a slow motion clip of Murphy running
"Abel continues singing along to ""Sidewalks"" in his expensive vehicle"
Cut to a view of a mountain in the distance
There is ambience in the background
"Abel, wearing a blue baseball cap, gets out of his P1"
He walks into the nightclub
"""Secrets"" begins to play and Abel sings along"
Everybody in the club is dancing
There is a young woman dancing seductively in the middle and Abel has his eye on her
"Under a fading blue light, Abel and the woman from the previous scene are becoming extremely close and dancing slowly and romantically with one another"
A man is watching them from a distance with jealousy
The music fades and Abel is seen in the bathroom using water to make sure his hair looks perfect for his newly found woman of interest
The jealous man walks up to him from behind as he washes his face in the sink
He then lunges for Abel with his knife and blood spurts everywhere
The music stops and Murphy roars
Abel is covered in blood
"The man lays dead on the floor, still bleeding"
The woman from earlier is stood above his body in an all-black outfit
She presumably saved Abel from being knifed
"The scene cuts to the nightclub and Abel, who still has a trail of blood on the side of his face, is dancing with his woman and mouthing along the lyrics to the song as it plays in the background"
Cut to flashing blue lights
Abel is singing to the track
Him and his girl are seen stood where Murphy the leopard was sat in the area from the first scene

Inspiration is all I know
Inspiration is all I have
I deserve your body on my mattress
What do I do now that you’re gone?
What do I do when I’m alone?
You’ve been running in my head
What do I do when I need sex?
I thought I told you
A long time ago
Don’t you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me

"Cant believe I made it, but I made it, thats for sure"
"For sure, your lovin, I need more, I need yours"
She aint lookin for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on? They want what Im sippin on
"They dont want my love, they just want my potential"
"Fuck it, Ill keep sippin on this, baby livin off of this"
"Got me drownin in your love, you got me drownin in abyss"
"Give me wet attention, Ill start drowning from my wrists, wrist"
And baby if you need a little more
The feelings I would give to you
"You, you, you, you"
The feelings I would give to you
When a shot turns a stare into a smile
And smiles into removals of a dress
"She got confidence, and her mind is so strong"
And shes been loaded like a gun
And the Bible compels her to resist the thing she most appreciates
And she hide all the demons with her makeup
Painting lies all on her face

"Hannah is free (Free), free (Free), free (Free, free)"
"Hannah is (Hannah, be free), Hannah and Evelyn (Free)"

"Her lips, so cold, high heels, open toes"
Hardly wearing any clothes

Know that I dont
"But I dont, when its on"
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know but you come all alone?
How will I know?
How will I know?
"Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room"
"Different girls on the floor, distractin my thoughts of you (Baby, almost died)"
I turned into the man I used to be
"To be (Baby, almost died)"
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
"Didnt wanna wake up less you were beside me (Baby, almost died)"
"I just wanted to call you and say, and say (Baby, almost died)"
"Where are you now when I need you most? (Baby, almost died)"
Id give it all just to hold you close
"Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart"
"Never comin down, uh"
"I was running away from facin reality, uh"
Wastin all of my time out living my fantasies
"Spendin money to compensate, compensate"
"Cause I want you, baby, uh"
I be livin in heaven when Im inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin beside you
"Ill never let you down again, again"
Where are you now when I need you most?
Id give it all just to hold you close
"Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart"
Ill treat you better than I did before
Ill hold you down and not let you go
"This time, I wont break your heart, your heart, yeah"
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
"Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart (Baby, almost died)"
"And I said, baby"
Ill treat you better than I did before
"Ill hold you down and not let you go (Baby, almost died)"
I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have
"No matter what an artists ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you"
"My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy"
"Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand"
"I usually dont like to spoon feed my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same"
The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in
The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground
The girl holding on represents you
As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence pieces of clothing off at every shot)
"The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground"
"Even though I dont want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist"
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation
"I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal"
"You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for"
Ill never make you wait again
With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to Trilogy
"Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint"
"I want to save time, tonight"

Ask around about her
She dont get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
Thats why she aint approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She aint got time for lovin
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
"She rather die in the club, till she"
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
"You know how she get down, pop her for a check now"
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
"You know how she get down, pop her for a check now"
She dont depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She dont give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
"She dont need nobody waiting back home, she got it"
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She aint got time for lovin
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting

Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon get that fucking paper
And youll know her
When a shot turns a stare
And a smile slips off the strap
She has no confidence
She fears His holiness
Her life is nothing but a test
Cause the Bible commands her to resist the things she most appreciates
So she hides all her demons with her makeup
Hoping that hell open the gates
(Hannah why wont you listen to me)
Why dont you meet my friend Evelyn
Her lips are cold
High heels open toes
Shes hardly wearing any clothes
Shes got her confideant
Her friend dont like men
But does what Evelyn says
And right beside her bedside
In a miniskirt that isnt ever hers
They may call it the bedside
Its the only side I hope she preserves
Evelyns Free (So free)
"Oh Evelyn, Hannah why dont you be like Evelyn"

I cant feel my heart

That Ive had enough of troubled thoughts in my mind

Whats the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall
"Tell me what you see in this mirror that youre lookin, baby"
"Youre so ashamed, I see it in the look in your eyes"
"Youre afraid, I wanna show you whats inside of you"

Best believe this is a fuckin test of
"What you do, oh you know what you do"
Ima let you solve your own clues
Baby the hardest part is the will to come in
I know you lost respect for me
Say that you did
Could you give me one last kiss
So I could learn to feel again
Make me regret everything that Ive done
"And love again, love again"
Whats the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall
"Why dont you run away, run away from him"
And come running to me when youre on your knees
Cause I will give the right solution
I can do is love you one last time
Just to recollect memories in our mind
When everything is done dont act like you know me so well
"Ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh)"

A little bit of practice
I been waiting for you
It will take a bit of practice

Fuck these bitches like a hat trick
Take a couple pills for that magic
These models bout to get ratchet

Give a fuck about what a source say

"You will always be the past, and"
Youre just tryna get reactions from me
"But youre old news, hmm"

Cause all we been drinkin is De Leon

As long as we dont kill the energy

"Oh, fucking gone right now"
Fucking high right now
Morning to the evening
"Im gone, Im gone"
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
And girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
"Skys getting cold, were flying from the north"
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
A house full of pros that specialize in the hoin
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like Im split life living
Let the world listen
If a haters caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
"Yeah, we still tippin"
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money she be folding"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, oh"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, mhm no"
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it—virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when Im over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder Ima drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Zombies of the night
Niggas aint talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money is the motive"
"All that money, the money she be folding"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, oh"
"Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, mhm no"
She better slow down
Shell feel it in the morning
Aint she the kind of girl youll be seeing in the morning
"She too damn raw, aint no nigga that she holding"
Aint no nigga with the holding
"Man, that love is too damn foreign"
"All that money, the money is the motive"

"This molly got us zombie, got me feeling all sedated"
With a van full of hippies
"Who love us, so lovely"
They didnt even hesitate to touch us
"They love us, so we lust them"
No one will catch them
No one can help them
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
"Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it"
"Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it"
Then watch us chase it
"With a handful of pills, no chasers"
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
"Escaping, her van is a Wonderland"
And its half-past six
Read skies cause time dont exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and its four feet wide
But its a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
"Yeah, I get her wetter than a wet nap"
And no closed doors
"So I listen to her moans echo (Echo, echo, echo)"
"Echo (Echo, echo, echo)"

"I cut down on her man, be her fuckin story"
"Yeah, Im talking bout you, man, get to know me"
"Aint no offense, though, I promise you"

"Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room"
"Different girls on the floor, distractin my thoughts of you"
"I turned into the man I used to be, to be"
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didnt wanna wake up less you were beside me
"I just wanted to call you and say, and say"
Where are you now when I need you most?
Id give it all just to hold you close
"Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart"
"Never comin down, uh"
"I was running away from facin reality, uh"
Wastin all of my time out living my fantasies
"Spendin money to compensate, compensate"
"Cause I want you, baby, uh"
I be livin in heaven when Im inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin beside you
"Ill never let you down again, again"
Where are you now when I need you most?
Id give it all just to hold you close
"Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart"
Ill treat you better than I did before
Ill hold you down and not let you go
"This time, I wont break your heart, your heart, yeah"
I know its all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
"I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)"
"Cant hide the truth, Id stay with her in spite of you"
"You did some things that you regret, still ride for you"
Cause this house is not a home
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
"Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart"
"And I said, baby"
Ill treat you better than I did before
Ill hold you down and not let you go
"This time, I wont break your heart, your heart, no"

Walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch

"Girl, if your man call your phone again"
"Girl, if your man call your phone again"
And you might think it feels good to be with him
But just wait until stuff happens and one day-
You both argue and then he shuts the door slammed
"Oh, hey oh, hey"
"Oh, guess you shouldn’t have gotten with him in the first place"

"Id be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you"
"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing"
"Id be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you"

The one I couldnt stand to be with was myself
"Cause Id be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you"
"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing"
"Pick up your phone, do you love me? (Oh)"
"If I die tonight, would you regret it, whoa-whoa?"

Light a blunt up with the flame
Put that cocaine on a plate
Molly with the purple rain
Cause I lost my faith
"So I cut away the pain, uh"
Got it swimming in my veins
"Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh"
Cause I lost my faith
And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
"Well, I feel everything"
When Im coming down is the most I feel alone
"Ive been sober for a year, now its time for me"
"To go back to my old ways, dont you cry for me"
"Thought Id be a better man, but I lied to me and to you"
I take half a Xan and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heavens gate
"I tried to love, but you know Id never stay"
"But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me"
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while Im smiling
And if you know me
"When I go missing, you know where to find me"
Driving down the boulevard is blinding
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I feel everything from my body to my soul
"Girl, I feel everything"
When Im coming down is the most I feel alone
I lost my faith
Im losing my religion every day
"Time hasnt been kind to me, I pray"
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
"Oh, someone, I love"
Im losing my religion every day
"Time hasnt been kind to me, I pray"
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
"Oh, someone, I love"
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again

Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you wont care

Cause tonight Ill be right here
And tomorrow you wont care
I leave it all to you

Common love isnt for us

You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it

"Im on an island, even when youre close"
"Cant take the silence, Id rather be alone"
"I think its pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could"
Its time I wave goodbye from the window
Lets end this like we should and say were good
Were not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So lets at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody else
As long as you swear you wont be pissed when I do it myself
Lets end it like we should and say were good
"No need to hide it, go get what you want"
This wont be a burden if we both dont hold a grudge

Were not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine

So lets at least agree to go our separate ways

Not gonna judge you when youre with somebody else
As long as you swear you wont be pissed when I do it myself
"Here, where the skys falling"
Im covered in blue
Im running and Im crawling
"When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?"
"And I know I go all in, but why do I?"
"You give me a reason, something to believe in"
"I know, I know, I know"
"You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in"
"I know, I know, I know"
Its a bittersweet feeling
"Longing, and Im leaving"
"I go, I go, I go"
But I wish I was there with you
"Oh, I wish I was there with you"
Theres a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When Im walking on water
All my dreams have come true
"Still, nothing means nothing"
"You give me a reason, something to believe in"
"I know, I know, I know"
"You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in"

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
"Every time I knock, he cant help but let me in"
Must be homesick for the real
Im the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
"Where Im coming from, yeah"
Its the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause I’m hot like hell
Does it burn when Im not there?
And youre by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
Youre my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can’t let me know Im wanted
Can’t let me in your head
Im not here to make you kneel
But its praise that I get
You aint gonna walk free boy
"Not finished with you yet, no"
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol

And youre by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
"Oh, youre down right there"
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause youre looking so right there
"Baby, you should touch me right there"
If you take me right there
We could make it
Cause Im hot like hell
Does it burn when Im not there?
And youre by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
And Ill give it to you
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
"Show me that heavens right here, baby"
"Touch me, so I know Im not crazy"
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
"So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain"
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
Id rather die than have to live in a storm like before
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
"Show me that heavens right here, baby"
"Touch me, so I know Im not crazy"
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
"I cant believe, I cant believe"
I finally found someone
Ill sink my teeth in disbelief
Cause youre the one that I want
"I cant believe, I cant believe"
Im not afraid anymore
"Goddamn, you got me in love again"
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought Id hear my heart beat so loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
"Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again"
"(Were in love, were in love)"
"(Were in love, were in love, oh, oh)"
"I cant believe, I cant believe"
I finally found someone
Ill sink my teeth in disbelief
Cause youre the one that I want
I cant believe theres something left inside my chest anymore
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Its second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when theres boys around
Isnt it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When theres nothing funny here? (Ah)
"Sick intuition that they taught us, so we wont freak out"
"We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths"
We smile away to ease the tension so it dont go south
But theres nothing funny now (Ah)
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
"No, the kids aint alright"
"Oh, and they do what they see"
Cause its all on TV
"Oh, the kids aint alright"
"Boys will be, boys will be"
"Boys will be, boys will be boys"
But girls will be women
"Boys will be, boys will be"
"Boys will be, boys will be boys"
But girls will be women
Im sure if theres something that I cant find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
"And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained"
I shouldve stuck to ballet (Ah)
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
"No, the kids aint alright"
"Oh, and they do what they see"
Cause its all on TV
"Oh, the kids aint alright"
"Boys will be, boys will be"
"Boys will be, boys will be boys"
But girls will be women
"Boys will be, boys will be"
"Boys will be, boys will be boys"
But girls will be women
If youre offended by this song
Youre clearly doing something wrong
If youre offended by this song
Then youre probably saying
"Boys will be, boys will be"
"Boys will be, boys will be boys"
But girls will be women
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?
"No, the kids aint alright"
"Oh, and they do what they see"
Cause its all on TV
"Oh, the kids aint alright"
"Boys will be, boys will be"
"Boys will be, boys will be boys"
But girls will be women
"Boys will be, boys will be"
"Boys will be, boys will be boys"
and my neighbors hate me
"Music blasting, shaking these walls"
This time Mary Jane wont save me
"Ive been working later, Ive been drinking stronger"
Ive been smoking deeper but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
"I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through"
I cant stop thinking bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze wont put my mind at ease
"Ive been sleeping later, Ive been breathing stronger"
"Ive been digging deeper, but the memories wont stop"
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
"I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through"
I cant stop thinking bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before its too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
"I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through"
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you
"I cant get high, I cant get by, I cant get through"
"In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth"
"For what its worth, I think that He mightve created you first"
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night
Ive been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights dont mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
"Im sorry, so sorry"
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
"Without you, Ive got no air to breathe in"
How can we go back to the beginning?
Dont matter whats written
"We can start all over again, all over again"
"Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?"
My deep intuition tells me that Im doing you wrong
If I dont come home
Just say you forgive me and dont let me go
Ive been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights dont mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize

You know Ill keep trying
Til the sun starts rising
I need your love
And Im dying for the rush
Cause my heart aint got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that its not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
"Without you, Ive got no air to breathe in"
"Yeah, lets get to the point here"
"You love to disappoint me, dont ya?"
"You tell me what I want, but aint no follow through"
"You dont follow through, no"
But if you only knew me
"The way you know my body, baby"
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
"We could make it through, but"
Ive been thinking itd be better
If we didnt know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking itd be better
If we didnt stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
"I know its really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad"

All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
"Thats what we do, yeah (Oh)"
"You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)"
"But when youre going down, I get so up (So up)"
Dont know if I can find someone who do me like you do
Ive been thinking itd be better

Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking itd be better
If we didnt stay together

"And this, baby, aint no fair, taking up my youth"
"Youve been telling me some lies, I be thinking its the truth"
"But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do"
I dont wanna waste no time all alone
"Want somewhere to go, something to call my own"
"And I aint satisfied, where to go?"
"Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore"
And Ive been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
"And Ive been far, and Ive been so deep"
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
"New love, new love"

To all of my friends who say that Ive gone mad
I dont wanna waste no time all alone

"If were not getting on, getting on?"
Can we just let it go?
Cause were waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah
And Ive been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
"And Ive been far, and Ive been so deep"
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love

Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance

Like its our last dance
"Maybe one day, I can see you"
"We can smile and wave, and itll be okay"
"Maybe one day, itll be cool"
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
"Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me"
"Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back"
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
"And so, I guess some things are not meant to last"
Is it too much to ask?
Lets love like theres no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Pretend that its all alright (All alright)
"Why dont we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?"
Lets love like theres no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
In a dark room
We dont have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though its too late
Lets love like theres no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Pretend that its all alright (All alright)

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know whats deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know whats in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Cant get back again
"Tell me, is there light on the outside?"
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight Im so self conscious
Isnt it so clear to see?
Nothings ever perfect in Paradise
Dont know what its worth til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
Cause we dont believe in this Garden of Eden
This Garden of Eden?
"I have cried for you, and Ill ride for you"
"I would die for you, but would you do that for me?"
"Tell the truth, what you wanna do"
Is it me and you?
"Are you with me, honey?"
"I have cried for you, and Ill ride for you"
"I would die for you, but would you do that for me?"

"I was five, and he was six"
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
He shot me down
I hit the ground
My baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
"When I grew up, I called him mine"
He would always laugh and say
"""Remember when we used to play"""
I shot you down
You hit the ground
I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
"Now hes gone, I dont know why"
"And til this day, I sometimes cry"
He didnt even say goodbye
He didnt take the time to lie
He shot me down
I hit the ground
My baby shot me down
"Know youre bad for me, but you know I am too"
"Me and you together, like a loved up bruise"
Ill make you an offer that you cant refuse
"No, you wont, wont go breaking my heart"
"Youve seen that we got the same pain, same scar"
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
"When youre far away, I promise you Ill be good"
I guess were misunderstood
"So baby, please, dont hear what people say"
Cause Ive heard things bout you too
Makes me know that Im for you
"Oh, no, I dont care whats been done here before me"
"I dont give a damn, just as long as you care"
"Cause, baby, Ive been bad, but the heavens forgave me"
You dont need to ask cause Im already there
"Lets be bad together, baby, you and I"
"Lets be bad together, if only for a while"
"Lets be bad together, make the devil smile"
"Lets be bad together, lets be bad together, ooh yeah"
"Nothing could stop us, we got it all"
"The love, the passion, but most of all"
"We mess up, but run from the scene"
"But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean"
"Ah, cause Im not afraid to tell you when youre wrong"
And I know that you miss me when Im gone
We make a great team
"With you, Im badder than Ive ever been"
"When youre far away, I promise you Ill be good"
I guess were misunderstood
"So baby, please, dont hear what people say"
Cause Ive heard things bout you too

"Lets be bad together, if only for a while"
"Lets be bad together, make the devil smile"

"One look was enough, enough for me"
The whole room stops
"And its not me to be one, to be one"
Cause its a hundred others speaking
Ive been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I cant make you understand
"Theres only one out here for ya, one out here for ya"
"Ill be the first to say, ""Baby, whats your name?"""

"Hard to pretend, now I cant sit still, let me show ya"
That kind of woman (Woman)

"Hard to pretend, now I cant sit still any longer"
"You and me, we made a vow"
For better or for worse
I cant believe you let me down
But the truths in the way it hurts
For months on end Ive had my doubts
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say Im crazy
Cause you dont think I know what youve done
But when you call me baby
I know Im not the only one
Youve been so unavailable
"And sadly, I know why"
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say Im crazy
Cause you dont think I know what youve done
But when you call me baby
I know Im not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
Youve made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say Im crazy
Cause you dont think I know what youve done
But when you call me baby
I know Im not the only one
"And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know"
I know Im not the only one

I know Im not the only oneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Too good to be true and thats what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain
Something I do that I cant explain

Such a sad disco if it aint me
"And baby, if you ever (Ah-ah)"
"Find another lover, youll see"
Ill be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it aint me
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
"Playing tricks on my imagination, ruining my night, wow"
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes

Of your kiss and your warm embrace

What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug thatd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you its actually gon be a good day?
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe its because youre running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
What do you need?
What do you need to show you theres better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you Im always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe its because youre running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And Im still here
And Im holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like youre never gonna understand
"One can drown alone, but we can swim together"
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because youre running low on gear?
I see the lights
"Dancing, dancing in your eyes"
"So how do I begin, to tell you now"

In this life of sin

"Tell me you believe, get down on your knees"
"They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me"
"I dont wanna preach, but I’m all that you need"

The one that played while I was layin in your arms
"Just let me stay in your arms, ’cause"
"I can be your gold, I can be your delight"
"I can feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice"
"I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life"
Put your hands together and close your eyes
"Tell me you believe, get down on your knees"

Im sorry if I seem uninterested
"Or Im not listenin, or Im indifferent"
Truly I aint got no business here
"But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it"
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who dont even care about my well-being
"I dont dance, dont ask"
I dont need a boyfriend
So you can go back
"Please enjoy your party, Ill be here"
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy whos hollering I can hardly hear
"Over this music I dont listen to, and I dont wanna get with you"
So tell my friends that Ill be over here
"Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here"
"Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin here?"
"Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here"
And I cant wait til we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
"An anti-social pessimist, but usually I dont mess with this"
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions arent to bother me
But honestly Id rather be somewhere with my people
"We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do"
And well discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope youll understand that Ill be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl whos always gossiping about her friends
So tell them Ill be here
Right next to the boy whos throwin up cause he cant take whats in his cup no more
"Oh, God, why am I here?"
"Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here"
"Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin here?"
"Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here"
And I cant wait til we can break up outta here
"Hours later, congregatin next to the refrigerator"
"Some girl talkin bout her haters, she aint got none"
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
"So holla at me, Ill be in the car when youre done"
Dont want what youre offerin
And Im done talkin
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when theyre ready that Im ready
And Im standin at the TV with my beanie low
"Yo, Ill be over here"
"Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here"
"Ask myself, what am I doin here?"
"Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here"

You cant tie heartstrings when theyre left undone
You cant go back when youve left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didnt intend
And I just wanna make amends
"Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me"
"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me"

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
"And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down"
"Down, down, down, down"
"In the darkness, I hear your voice"
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
"Without you, my heart makes no noise"
"Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me"
"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me"
"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah"

Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you cant shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that youre in deep?
Ive dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
Cause theres this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee
Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
"Baby, we both know"
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when youve had a few?
Cause I always do
Maybe Im too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now Ive thought it through
Crawling back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your hearts still open
"And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts"
Simmer down and pucker up
"Im sorry to interrupt, its just Im constantly on the cusp"
Of trying to kiss you
I dont know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to
Do I wanna know?

"Moi, jai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges"
Et tu voudrais quon se lance
"Ton amour, je men lave les mains et tu ten mords les doigts"
"Oui, jai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges"

I look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing
"Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something"
"Side by side, lying next to you"
All I need is you to protect me til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
"I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears"

"See, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya"
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
"See, I love you, but I dont like that"
"I leave, but then I come right back to you"
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and dont have to think no more
Get high as a plane
"Cause sober, we drive each other insane"
"And we know if we dont, we gon start fighting again"
"So either we smoke, drink, or we break up"
"Either we smoke, drink, or we break up"
Cause the only time we dont fight
"Is when we drunk or we high, oh why"
"Smoke, or we drink, or we break up"

"So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker"
And calling each other out our names like bitches and n-

Corona out the kitchen
"So either we smoke, drink, or we break up"

Such a cruel world

Some prick at the party
All scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl
And then theres you
You put a spell on me
And youre lockin up the bathroom door for us

"Wait a minute, uh"
You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
"Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care"
I’m so lost in all this madness
So Im throwing up a flare
"But you know, baby, I’m a problem"
Tryna act like Im not scared
Caught me in ways that I cant explain
You got me questioning all my faith
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
"Act of God, don’t know how it started"
"Now Im boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it"
"I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe"
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
"Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it"

And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
"Lay my hands on me, ooh"
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)
Could this be a revelation?
"Tell me, is this what I need?"
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
"Is this all an accident, or is this by design?"
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine (Need it to be)
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused (Confused)
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you

It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
"But then I got lost, lost in you, babe"
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me

Met a boy and he told me
That life gon burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
"Still, won’t know what you’re about"
"You got your issues, your tissues"
You cry every night
I guess he was right
Livin out of that suitcase
"He said ""girl better get on your way"
"Keep chasing the dragon"""
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
"’Cause you know that, ooh"
Nothing bout me’s typical
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Another thing that he told me
"""It’s gonna be a long, long daylight"""
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
"I’ll keep my issues, my tissues"
Keep runnin the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin out of my suitcase
"He said ""girl better get on your way"
"Keep chasing the dragon"""
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
"’Cause you know that, ooh"
Nothing bout me’s typical
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
No matter what he said to me
"I’m gonna be running free, ooh"
"I just wanna fly, you see"
Ain’t nothing stopping me
Keep chasing the dragon
Keep chasing the dragon
’Cause you know that
Nothing bout me’s typical
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon

"What a year for dating, crazy"
Nothin is the way it was
People textin exes sex pics
From the basement at their moms
If you have human contact
Dont know what youll contract
So your first dates always on Zoom (Oh)
You just wish you could just go out
Get a little naughty
"Girl, youre drunk on FaceTime"
"Theres no bars, theres no school"
Poundin Claws in a kitty pool
Thirsty slides through DMs
Now you landed in their close friends
No matter how you try to break through
It all feels like a waste of time
When youve gotten your face off Netflix
"Hulu, HBO, and Prime"
Now youre lookin ready
"Though, its low-key scary"
Check your drip and grab your Lysol (Oh)
If youre ever wanna see another persons body
"If you zap on your forehead, youre a total hottie"
"Wear a mask, wash your hands"
Its not like you have other plans
"Its awkward, but its cool"
Following all these COVID rules (COVID rules)
"One: Get in the zone, no more doing edibles at home alone"
Two: Stalk their Instagram
Gotta background check if you wanna slam
Three: Up your waxin game
No ones seen you naked since February
"And if you hit it off, watch out if they start to cough"
I got new rules for dating
"Six feet apart, no mating"
Masks can be irritating
These are the rules for dating
"One: Theres a new third base, thats when you get to see their lower face"
"Two: Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough"
"Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick em when you wake up in the morning"
"Youre feelin numb, its you, your hand, and OnlyFans"
Weve got rules for dating
Its your neighbors youre saving
Youll get that touch youre craving
"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy"
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music dont stop for life
"Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes"
Shining just the way I like
If youre feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
"You want me, I want you, baby"
"My sugarboo, Im levitating"
"The Milky Way, were renegading"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
"I got you, moonlight, youre my starlight"
"I need you all night, come on, dancе with me"
"I got you, moonlight, youre my starlight"
"I need you all night, come on, dancе with me"
"All night, all night, all night"
"I believe that youre for me, I feel it in our energy"
I see us written in the stars
"We can go wherever, so lets do it now or never"
"Baby, nothings ever, ever too far"
"Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes"
Shining just the way we are
I feel like were forever every time we get together
"But whatever, lets get lost on Mars"
"You want me, I want you, baby"
"My sugarboo, Im levitating"
"The Milky Way, were renegading"

While Im laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of broken dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
Tell me are we meant to be
"Oh, we used to burn bright"
But now Im turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said youd be mine
But Ive been waiting a lifetime
(And I cant stand the pain)
"Dont you beg me for forgiveness, oh no"
Dont mistake my love for weakness
If you think Id run around and round chasing you
"Leave me hanging here like a fool, no"
"You can have it all, all"
"Cause its all or nothing, all or nothing"
"(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)"
"(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)"
Loving you was like a pill
I stayed cause I liked the thrill
"But now were just wasting time (time, time)"
Ive been waiting weeks all night
You know that were more than friends
Weve been livin in denial
"Oh, we used to burn bright"
But now Im turning the lights off

You said youd be mine

Lets wait till the dark gets lighter
Can you spark me up your last cigarette?
"I promise you, youll never forget"
What feels to be living larger
My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest

A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we cant control this familiar feeling between us
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know whеn the time is right
For now lets keep it sеcret
"Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"
"Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"
Lemme savor all your flavors
"And I don’t wanna, yeah"
I don’t wanna share with no one
"Feel them watching, but we ain’t talking"
"Boy, I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna"
"I been waiting for you, been waiting for me"

One day we could tell ‘em all
We could tell ‘em how
We could tell ‘em when
We could tell ‘em what
But for now let’s keep it secret
One day we could reminisce
When nobody knew about the way we kiss
And the way we touch
But for now let’s keep it secret

Even though we’re touching each other

Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you

Dont you wear your own mouth?
Walking around and throwing shade
Caught up in your mind games
But did I think youd ever change?

Found a home in your heartbeat

Theres a madness that surrounds me
And when youre a thousand miles away
Im holding on for you

Cause Ive fallen under you
Is this what they call love?
Cause I cant get enough
Youre my heavy rain
You drench me off with nothing
"For all you gotta say, at least can you mean something?"
And when youre a thousand miles away

Swaying to those red lights

I want you to stay
Its not much of a life youre living

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought Id hear my heart beating loud
I cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
"Touch me, take me to heaven, wont you?"
"Show me, youre looking so good on me"
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
"But goddamn, you got me in love again"
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone

You call me all friendly
Tellin me how much you miss me
"Thats funny, I guess youve heard my songs"
"Well, Im too busy for your business"
Go find a girl who wants to listen
"Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong"
So I cut you off
I dont need your love
Cause I already cried enough
Ive been movin on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I dont need your love
So you can try all you want
"Your time is up, Ill tell you why"
"You say youre sorry, but its too late now"
"So save it, get gone, shut up"
Cause if you think I care about you now
"Well, boy, I dont give a fuck"
"(Boy, I dont give a fuck)"
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
"Cause you made your bed, sleep in it"
Play the victim and switch your position
"Im through, Im done"
So I cut you off
I dont need your love

"Troubled nights, a troubled guy"
With nothing but entitlement behind his eyes
I wish I saw right through the lies
"In that disguise, so criminal"
Words can cut deep like a knife
"And I know that you did it all, all out of spite"
You tried to pull me down
"When I was ridin’ high, hypocritical"
I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door
"We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate"
‘Cause you and me together was my greatest mistake
"I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say"
You and me together are better this way
"He who comes, he who goes"
"There’s nothing like a boy with a, a bruisin soul"
Who runs their mouth as if he knows
"So critical, so critical"
I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door
"We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate"
‘Cause you and me together
Was my greatest mistake
"I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say"
You and me together are better this way
Times the only reason we decided to stay
We tried to let it go but got stuck in our ways
Were pullin’ on the chain
We were bound to break
You and me together are better this way
Better this way (Way)
Better this way (Way)
Better this way (Way)
You and me together are better this way
You made me better
And knowing what I really want
Knowing who I really am
Ill never settle for nothing less than I deserve
Thank you for the lesson learned

You hung a cigarette between your purple lips

"You say youre sorry, but its too late now"
"So save it, get gone, shut up"
Cause if you think I care about you now
"Well, boy, I dont give a fuck"
(Im a big boss and you a tiny man)
I see you tryna get to me
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin on your knees
"Boy, I dont give a fuck"

"(Terms and conditions, hmm)"
There’s a waste of time
Smoke inhale it all
Take the pain off my mind
Im sorry ‘bout the way that I’ve acted lately
I know you just care and you just wanna save me
Trying to enhance the performance of my mind
Taking advice from buried bombs
And this time I may be (I may be)
"Out of line, I may be (I may be)"
"Out of time, oh my"
"Oh, the stars I count fall from the sky (From the sky)"
"Cause you, youve been my Angel in disguise (In disguise)"
"But I just wanna, I just wanna I just wanna"
I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
Thеse are my (Thesе are my)
"These are my, these are my"
"Th-these are my, these are my"
"I’e just been exploring, and honesty is boring"
If you’re looking for a summary of my life
I tried to do something you thought was incapable
Tried to be someone you think is unchangeable
But who I am has always been the person I am inside
That person is too inescapable
And I know that you had got some things to say
But maybe those things are debatable
So fade the lights to black
And go in the spooky black
And one of these days maybe I’ll call you back
"Oh, the stars I count fall from the sky (From the sky)"
"‘Cause you, you’ve been my Angel in disguise (In disguise)"
"But I just wanna, I just wanna I just wanna"
I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
These are my (These are my)
"These are my, these are my"
Terms and conditions (These are my)
Ter-terms and conditions (These are my)
Terms and conditions (These are my)
"Th-these are my, these are my (My)"
"(Terms and conditions, eh, terms and conditions)"
"Oh, there’s stars that can’t fall from the sky"
"(From the sky, oh)"
"‘Cause you, you’ve been my Angel in disguise"
"(In disguise) But I just wanna, I just wanna"
"I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight"

Its second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when theres boys around
Isnt it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When theres nothing funny here? (Ah)
"Sick intuition that they taught us, so we wont freak out"
"We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths"
We smile away to ease the tension so it dont go south
But theres nothing funny now (Ah)
When will we stop saying things
Cause theyre all listening?

I know that there will be a man around to save the day

Dont know if I can find someone who do me like you do

"Yeah, we might just end up crashin"
But Im ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when Im far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
Youre the only thing I know
And I dont wanna let this go
"Close to you I feel, feel like Im at home"
Cant wait til were alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
"Baby, take my hand"
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Left my heart wide open
Fallin in and out of focus
Pressure flowin like a river in my head
Crying you aint with me and its floodin the whole city
While my souls burnin like a cigarette
Youre the only thing I know
And I dont wanna let this go
"Close to you I feel, feel like Im at home"
Cant wait til were alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
Was it worth it?

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze wont put my mind at ease

Ive been digging deeper but the memories wont stop
I cant stop thinking bout you
I cant stop thinking bout you

"Yeah, we might just end up crashin"
But Im ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when Im far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
Youre the only thing I know
And I dont wanna let this go
"Close to you I feel, feel like Im at home"
Cant wait til were alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
"Baby, take my hand"
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Left my heart wide open
Fallin in and out of focus
Pressure flowin like a river in my head
Crying you aint with me and its floodin the whole city
While my souls burnin like a cigarette
Youre the only thing I know
And I dont wanna let this go
"Close to you I feel, feel like Im at home"
Cant wait til were alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Like its our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
Was it worth it?
Like its our last dance

Have you ever seen
Some people lose everything
First to go is their mind
To me is a tragedy
Ill get a job some other time
I want to join a band
And play in front of crazy fans
"Yes, I call that temptation Give me the melody"
Thats all that I ever need
The music is my salvation
Were lost in music
Caught in a trap (Caught up!)
No turnin back (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Were lost in music

Ive always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
You say my name like I have never heard before
"Im indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure"
I hope Im not the only one that feels it all
I wouldve stayed at home
"I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind"
"Two can play that game, but you win me every time"
Everyone before you was a waste of time (I know)
"Yeah, you got me"
You know you can get whatever you want from me
"Whenever you want it, baby"
Its you in my reflection
Im afraid of all the things it could do to me

El me llama el diablo
Le hago querer pecar
"Cada vez que llamo, no puede evitar dejarme entrar"
Debe sentir nostalgia por lo real
Soy el mas real que se pone
Probablemente todavía me adoras
Con mis manos alrededor de tu cuello
¿Puedes sentir el calor? Si
"Mientras mi beso baja, como un alcohol dulce"
"De donde vengo, si"
Es mi lado oscuro lo que te hace sentir tan insensible
Porque estoy caliente como el infierno
¿Arde cuando no estoy ahí?
¿Soy la respuesta a tus oraciones?
Te estoy dando ese placer el cielo
Y te lo daré
Más caliente que el infierno
Más caliente que el infierno
Eres mi maná del cielo
Todos tenemos que alimentarnos
No puedes dejarme saber que me quieren
No puedes dejarme entrar en tu cabeza
No estoy aquí para hacerte arrodillarte
Pero es un elogio lo que recibo
No vas a caminar libre chico
"Aún no he terminado contigo, no"
¿Puedes sentir el calor? Si

"Oh, estás ahí abajo"
Me haces sentir justo ahí
Cuando me acuestas ahí
Lo hacemos justo ahí
Porque te ves tan justo ahí
"Bebé, deberías tocarme ahí mismo"
Si me llevas justo ahí
Porque estoy caliente como el infierno
¿Arde cuando no estoy ahí?

Así que deja de intentar llegar a mí
"Tch, levántate de rodillas"
"Porque, chico, me importa un carajo"
"No, me importa un carajo"
Sigues recordando cuando eras mi hombre
Ahora estás en el pasado
"Hablas toda esa dulce charla, pero no voy a volver"
No necesito tu amor
Para que puedas probar todo lo que quieras
"Tu tiempo se acabó, te diré por qué"
"Dices que lo sientes, pero ya es demasiado tarde"
"Así que guárdalo, vete, cállate"
Porque si crees que me preocupo por ti ahora
"Bueno, chico, me importa un carajo"
"(Chico, no me importa un)"
Veo que intentas llegar a mi
Te veo rogando de rodillas
"Chico, me importa un carajo"
Así que deja de intentar llegar a mí (llegar a mí)
"Tch, levántate de rodillas"
"Porque, chico, me importa un carajoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
"Every time I knock, he cant help but let me in"
Must be homesick for the real
Im the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
"Where Im coming from, yeah"
Its the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause I’m hot like hell
Does it burn when Im not there?
And youre by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
Youre my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can’t let me know Im wanted
Can’t let me in your head
Im not here to make you kneel
But its praise that I get
You aint gonna walk free boy
"Not finished with you yet, no"
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
"Where I’m coming from, yeah"
Its the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause Im hot like hell
Does it burn when Im not there?
And youre by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
"Oh, youre down right there"
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause youre looking so right there
"Baby, you should touch me right there"
If you take me right there
We could make it
Cause Im hot like hell
Does it burn when Im not there?
And youre by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
Im giving you that pleasure heaven
And Ill give it to you
And Ill give it to you
Hotter than hellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
While Im laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of broken dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
Tell me are we meant to be
"Oh, we used to burn bright"
But now Im turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said youd be mine
But Ive been waiting a lifetime
(And I cant stand the pain)
"Dont you beg me for forgiveness, oh no"
Dont mistake my love for weakness
If you think Id run around and round chasing you
"Leave me hanging here like a fool, no"
"You can have it nerf, nеrf"
"Cause its nerf or nothing, nerf or nothing"
"(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)"
"(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)"
Loving you was like a pill
I stayed cause I liked the thrill
"But now were just wasting time (time, time)"
Ive been waiting weeks all night
You know that were more than friends
Weve been livin in denial
"Oh, we used to burn bright"
But now Im turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said youd be mine
But Ive been waiting a lifetime
(And I cant stand the pain)
"Dont you beg me for forgiveness, oh no"
Dont mistake my love for weakness
If you think Id run around and round chasing you
"Leave me hanging here like a fool, no"
"You can have it nerf, nerf"
"Cause its nerf or nothing, nerf or nothing"

Dont you beg me for forgiveness
Dont mistake my love for weakness
"Dont you beg me for forgiveness, oh no"
Dont mistake my love for weakness
If you think Id run around and round chasing you
"Leave me hanging here like a fool, no"

"Just stop your crying, its a sign of the times"
Welcome to the final show
Hope youre wearing your best clothes
You cant bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you aint really good
"We never learn, we been here before"
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
"We never learn, we been here before"
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets? Your bullets?
"Just stop your crying, its a sign of the times"
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
"Just stop your crying, itll be alright"
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
"Just stop your crying, have the time of your life"
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here
"We never learn, we been here before"
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
"We never learn, we been here before"
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
"Just stop your crying, its a sign of the times"
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
"Stop your crying, baby, itll be alright"
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
"We never learn, we been here before"
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
"We never learn, weve been here before"
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? Your bullets?
"We dont talk enough, we should open up"
Before its all too much
Will we ever learn? Weve been here before
Its just what we know
"Stop your crying, baby, its a sign of the times"
"We gotta get away, we got to get away"
"We got to get away, we got to get away"
We got to get away
"We got to, we got to, away"
"We got to, we got to, away"
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin
Its so wonderful and warm
"Breathe me in, breathe me out"
I dont know if I could ever go without
Im just thinking out loud
I dont know if I could ever go without
Strawberries on a summer evenin
"Baby, youre the end of June"
I want your belly and that summer feelin
Getting washed away in you
"Breathe me in, breathe me out"
I dont know if I could ever go without
"I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it"
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly and that summer feelin
I dont know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
"I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Eh-eh-eh)"
"I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Ooh, yeah)"
Im in my bed
And youre not here
And theres no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
Its not what I meant
"And I cant take it back, I cant unpack the baggage you left"
What am I now? What am I now?
What if Im someone I dont want around?
"Im falling again, Im falling again, Im fallin"
What if Im down? What if Im out?
What if Im someone you wont talk about?
"Im falling again, Im falling again, Im fallin"
"You said you cared, and you missed me too"
And Im well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffees out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me cause I know weve run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if Im someone I dont want around?
"Im falling again, Im falling again, Im fallin"
What if Im down? What if Im out?
What if Im someone you wont talk about?
"Im falling again, Im falling again, Im fallin"
And I get the feeling that youll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if youre someone I just want around?
"Im falling again, Im falling again, Im fallin"
What if Im down? What if Im out?
What if Im someone you wont talk about?
Walk in your rainbow paradise (Paradise)
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You dont have to say you love me
You dont have to say nothing
You dont have to say youre mine
Id walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Id walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like its the only thing Ill ever do
Like its the only thing Ill ever do
Youre wonder under summer sky (Summer sky)
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?
You dont have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you somethin
"Lately, youve been on my mind"
Id walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Id walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like its the only thing Ill ever do
Like its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Its the only thing Ill ever do
Id walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Id walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like its the only thing Ill ever do (Ah-ah-ah)
"(Its the only thing Ill ever do, its the only thing Ill ever do)"
Id walk through fire for you (Its the only thing Ill ever do)
Just let me adore you
"Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah), oh, honey"
"(Its the only thing Ill ever do, its the only thing Ill ever do)"
Id walk through fire for you (Its the only thing Ill ever do)
Just let me adore you (Its the only thing Ill ever do)
Just let me adore you
Lyrics from live performances
"I’m here to take my medicine, take my medicine"
Treat you like a gentleman
"Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline"
Think Im gonna stick with you
"Here to take my medicine, take my medicine"
Rest it on your fingertips
"Up to your mouth, I’m feeling it out"
I’m felling it out
"I had a few, got drunk on you, and now Im wasted"
And when I sleep Im gonna dream of how you tasted
"If you go out tonight, Im going out cause I know youre persuasive"
"You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it"
"You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh"
La la la la la
"Were getting dizzy, oh, were getting dizzy, oh"
"Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes"
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are here
I mess around with him
And Im okay with it
"Im coming down, I figured out I kinda like it"
"And when I sleep, Im gonna dream of how you ride it"
"If you go out tonight, Im going out cause I know youre persuasive"
"You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it"
"You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh"
La la la la la
"Were getting dizzy, oh, were getting dizzy, oh"
"I had a few, got drunk on you, and now Im wasted"
"And when I sleep, I’m gonna dream of how you tasted"
"If you go out tonight, Im going out cause I know youre persuasive"
"You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it"
"You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh"
La la la la la
Put a price on emotion
Im looking for something to buy
Youve got my devotion
"But man, I can hate you sometimes"
I dont want to fight you
And I dont want to sleep in the dirt
Well get the drinks in
So Ill get to thinking of her
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Test of my patience
Theres things that well never know
"You sunshine, you temptress"
"My hands at risk, I fold"
Ill try to shake this soon
Is the only way of knowing you
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
Well be a fine line
"Well be alright (Alright, alright, alright)"
"Dont you call him ""baby"""
Were not talking lately
Dont you call him what you used to call me
"I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best"
Im selfish so Im hating it
I noticed that theres a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
"Dont you call him ""baby"""
Were not talking lately
Dont you call him what you used to call me
"I, I just miss"
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?
Does he take you walking round his parents gallery?
"Dont you call him ""baby"""
Were not talking lately
Dont you call him what you used to call me
"Dont you call him ""baby"" (Coucou)"
Were not talking lately
Dont you call him what you used to call me (Coucou)
"Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, jsuis désolée"
"Nan, cest pas important"
"Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—"
What do you mean?
Im sorry by the way
Never coming back down
"I could, but wouldnt stay"
Wouldnt put it like that
What do you mean?
Im sorry by the way
Itd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
All the lights couldnt put out the dark
Runnin through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are? (Oh)
"Shine, step into the light"
"Shine, so bright sometimes"
"Shine, Im not ever going back"
"Shine, step into the light"
"Shine, so bright sometimes"
"Shine, Im not ever going back"

"Shine, so bright sometimes"
"Shine, Im not ever (Ooh)"
What do you mean?
Im sorry by the way
Never going back now
Itd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
All the lights couldnt put out the dark
Runnin through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
"And all the boys, they were saying they were into it"
Such a pretty face
On a pretty neck
"Shes driving me crazy, but Im into it"
"But Im into it, Im kinda into it"
"Its getting crazy, I think Im losing it"
"I think Im losing it, oh, I think she said"
"""Im having your baby"""
"""Its none of your business"""
"""Im having your baby"""
"""Its none of your business"" (Its none of your, its none of your—)"
"""Im having your baby"" (Hey, ah)"
"""Its none of your business"" (Oh)"
"""Im having your baby"" (Hey, hey)"
"""Its none of your, its none of your—"" (Ow!)"
"Its New York, baby, always jacked up (Hey)"
"Holland Tunnel for a nose, its always backed up"
"When shes alone, she goes home to a cactus (Uh)"
In a black dress
Shes such an actress
"Driving me crazy, but Im into it"
"But Im into it, Im kinda into it"
"Its getting crazy, I think Im losing it"
"I think Im losing it, oh, I think she said"
"""Im having your baby"" (Hey)"
"""Its none of your business"" (Oh)"
"""Im having your baby"" (Hey)"
"""Its none of your business"" (Its none of your, its none of your—)"
"""Im having your baby"" (Hey)"
"""Its none of your business"" (Oh)"
"""Im having your baby"" (Hey)"
"""Its none of your, its none of your—"""
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me til my feet are wet
"And now shes all over me, its like I paid for it (Cha-ching!)"
Its like I paid for it
Im gonna pay for this
"Its none of your, its none of your—"
"""Im having your baby"" (Hey)"
"""Its none of your business"""

"Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes"
"Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light"
I know you were way too bright for me
"Im hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky"
Brown my skin just right
"Im out of my head, and I know that youre scared"
Because hearts get broken
I dont wanna be alone
I dont wanna be alone when it ends
Dont wanna let you know
I dont wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
"Of who I am, and all Ive ever known"
Lovin yous the antidote
I dont wanna be alone
"Im out of my head, and I know that youre scared"
Because hearts get broken
"(Golden, golden, golden, golden)"
"(Golden, golden, golden, golden)"
"(Golden, golden, golden, golden)"
"(Golden, golden, golden, golden)"
"(Golden, golden, golden, golden)"
"(Golden, golden, golden, golden)"
"(Golden, golden, golden, golden)"
I know that youre scared because Im so open
I dont wanna be alone
"Im out of my head, and I know that youre scared"
Had another talk about where its going wrong
But were still young
We dont know where were going
But we know where we belong
"And, oh, we started"
Two hearts in one home
Its hard when we argue
"Were both stubborn, I know"
"Sweet creature, sweet creature"
"Wherever I go, you bring me home"
"Sweet creature, sweet creature"
"When I run out of road, you bring me home"
Running through the garden
"Oh, where nothing bothered us"
But were still young
I always think about you and how we dont speak enough
"And, oh, we started"
Two hearts in one home
I know its hard when we argue
"Were both stubborn, I know"
"Sweet creature, sweet creature"
"Wherever I go, you bring me home"
"Sweet creature, sweet creature"
"When I run out of road, you bring me home"
"And, oh, when we started"
Just two hearts in one home
It gets hard when we argue
"Were both stubborn, I know"
"Sweet creature, sweet creature"
"Wherever I go, you bring me home"
"Sweet creature, sweet creature"
"When I run out of road, you bring me home"
"Same lips red, same eyes blue"
"Same white shirt, couple more tattoos"
But its not you and its not me
"Tastes so sweet, looks so real"
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I cant touch what I see
Were not who we used to be
Were not who we used to be
Were just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
This was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like weve never known
Telling those stories we already told
Cause we dont say what we really mean
Were not who we used to be
Were not who we used to be
Were just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Were not who we used to be
Were not who we used to be
Were just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
Were not who we used to be
Were not who we used to be
Were just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Were not who we used to be
We dont see what we used to see
Were just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
"Nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school"
"And hes thinking of you, like all of us do"
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
"Around 1:32, like he knows what to do"
"She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)"
"Shes the first one that I see, and I dont know why"
"I dont know who she is (She, she)"
"He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away (Away, away)"

"Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody"
"Let me inside, wish I could get to know you"
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
I dont wanna make you feel bad
But Ive been trying hard not to talk to you
I couldnt want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like its a dance floor
I couldnt want you any more
"Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)"
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you
Ive got your face hung up high in the gallery
"I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower"
"Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody"
"Let me inside, I wanna get to know you"
I dont wanna make you feel bad
But Ive been trying hard not to act a fool
I couldnt want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like its a dance floor
I couldnt want you any more
"Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)"
I couldnt want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall
I couldnt want you any more
"Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)"
"Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody"
"Let me inside, wish I could get to know you"
"Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory"
Dont blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasnt ready for it all
"You cant blame me, darling"
"Not even a little bit, I was away"
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who cant admit when hes sorry
"Dont call me ""baby"" again, you got your reasons"
"I know that youre tryna be friends, I know you mean it"
"Dont call me ""baby"" again, its hard for me to go home"
I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think its easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
"You’ll win, its just a trick"
"And this is it, so I’m sorry"
"Dont call me ""baby"" again, you got your reasons"
"I know that youre tryna be friends, I know you mean it"
"Dont call me ""baby"" again, it’s hard for me to go home"
"To be so lonely, to be so"
To be so lonely
"To be so lonely, to be so"
To be so lonely
And Im just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who cant admit when hes sorry
"Dont call me ""baby"" again, you got your reasons"
"I know that youre tryna be friends, I know you mean it"
"Dont call me ""baby"" again, its hard for me to go home"
"To be so lonely, to be so"
To be so lonely
"To be so lonely, to be so"
Woke up alone in this hotel room
"Played with myself, where were you?"
"Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon"
Ive never felt less cool
We havent spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why wont you ever be the first one to break?
"Even my phone misses your call, by the way"
I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
"I see its written, its all over his face"
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why wont you ever say what you want to say?
"Even my phone misses your call, by the way"
Maybe one day youll call me and tell me that youre sorry too
Maybe one day youll call me and tell me that youre sorry too
Maybe one day youll call me and tell me that youre sorry too
"But you, you never do"
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name
We havent spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why wont you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We havent spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why wont you ever say what you want to say?
I saw this angel
I really saw an angel
"Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see"
That Im still the only one whos been in love with me
Im just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And theres nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling cross the floor
Couldnt take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think thats what I like about it
"Shes an angel, only angel"
"Shes an angel, my only angel"
I must admit I thought Id like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And theres nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
"That shes gonna be an angel, just you wait and see"
When it turns out shes a devil in between the sheets
And theres nothing she can do about it
"Shes an angel, only angel"
"Shes an angel, my only angel"
"Shes an angel, only angel"
"Shes an angel, my only angel"
"Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight"
"Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight"
"Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight"
"Shes an angel, only angel"
"Shes an angel, my only angel"
"Shes an angel, my only angel"
"Tell me something, tell me something"
"You dont know nothing, just pretend you do"
"I need something, tell me something new"
"Choose your words, cause theres no antidote"
"For this curse, oh, whats it waiting for?"
Must this hurt you just before you go?
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news"
Theres no water inside this swimming pool
"Almost over, had enough from you"
"And Ive been praying, I never did before"
Understand Im talking to the walls
Ive been praying ever since New York
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Tell me something, tell me something"
"You dont know nothing, just pretend you do"
Tell me something just before you go
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
"Oh, tell me something I dont already know"
Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?
"Im selfish, I know"
But I dont ever want to see you with him
"Im selfish, I know"
"I told you, but I know you never listen"
I hope you can see the shape that Im in
While hes touching your skin
"Hes right where I should, where I should be"
But youre making me bleed
Apologies are never gonna fix this (Hmm-mm)
"Im empty, I know"
And promises are broken like a stitch is
"I hope you can see, the shape Ive been in"
While hes touching your skin
"This thing upon me, howls like a beast"
"You flower, you feast"
"Meet me in the hallway, meet me in the hallway"
"I just left your bedroom, give me some morphine"
Is there any more to do?
"Just let me know, Ill be at the door, at the door"
Hoping youll come around
"Just let me know Ill be on the floor, on the floor"
Maybe well work it out
"I gotta get better, gotta get better"
"I gotta get better, gotta get better"
"I gotta get better, gotta get better"
And maybe well work it out
"I walked the streets all day, running with the thieves"
Cause you left me in the hallway (Give me some more)
Just take the pain away
"Just let me know, Ill be at the door, at the door"
Hoping youll come around
"Just let me know, Ill be on the floor, on the floor"
Maybe well work it out
"I gotta get better, gotta get better"
"I gotta get better, gotta get better"
"I gotta get better, gotta get better"
And maybe well work it out
"We dont talk about it, its something we dont do"
"Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah"
Shes got a family in Carolina
"So far away, but she says I remind her of home"
Feeling oh so far from home
She never saw herself as a West Coaster
Moved all the way cause her grandma told her;
"""Townes, better swim before you drown"""
Shes a good girl
Shes such a good girl
Shes a good girl
She feels so good
Shes got a book for every situation
Gets into parties without invitations
How could you ever turn her down?
Theres not a drink that I think could sink her
How would I tell her that shes all I think about?
"Well, I guess she just found out"
Shes a good girl
Shes such a good girl
Shes a good girl
She feels so good
She feels so good
I met her once and wrote a song about her
"I wanna scream, I wanna shout it out"
And I hope she hears me now
Shes a good girl
Shes such a good girl
Shes a good girl
"Feels so good, she feels so good"
She feels so good
She feels so good
Shes a good girl
"Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue"
"So hard to leave it, thats what I always do"
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon
"The worlds happy waitin, doors yellow, broken blue"
"I heard Jenny saying, ""Go get the kids from school"""
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
Ill be gone too long from you
"Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and Ill be home"
"Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome"
And Im still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
"Im going, oh, Im going"
"Im going, oh, Im going"
"Im going, oh, Im going home"
"Im going, oh, Im going"
"Im going, oh, Im going"
"Im going, oh, Im going home"
"Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs Ive never heard"
"An old lovers hippie music, pretends not to know the words"
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
Ill be gone too long from you
"Im going, oh, Im going"
"Im going, oh, Im going"
"Im going, oh, Im going home"
"Im going, oh, Im going (Im going home)"
"Im going, oh, Im going (Im going home)"
"Im going, oh, Im going home (Yeah)"
"Im going, oh, Im going (Im going home)"
"Im going, oh, Im going (Im going home)"

Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
It aint slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
Shes giving you now
I want to taste her lips
"Yeah, cause they taste like you"
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
"Yeah, cause maybe then"
Youd want me just as much
And Ive got a girl crush
Ive got a girl crush
I dont get no sleep
I dont get no peace
Under your bed sheets
The way that shes whispering
The way that shes pulling you in
Lord knows Ive tried
I cant get her off my mind
I want to taste her lips
"Yeah, cause they taste like you"
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
"Yeah, cause maybe then"
Youd want me just as much
And Ive got a girl crush
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

Im just takin it all in
Floating up and dreamin
Droppin into the deep end
And if were here long enough
Theyll sing a song for us
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
I dont need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin
And if were here long enough
Well see its all for us
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And its just another day (And its just another day)
"And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
"Its okay (Its okay, its okay)"
"Its okay (Its okay, its okay, yeah)"
Here we go now
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
All we ever want is automatic all the time
"All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time"
All we ever want is automatic all the time
"All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time"
"Maybe, we can (All together now, one more time)"
Find a place to feel good (Oh yeah)
And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness)
Don’t know where you’re laying
Just know it’s not with me
Don’t know what I’d tell you if
I passed you on the street
"I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me"
"Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take"
Don’t know how you taste when
There’s smoke in your perfume
Chew me up and spit me out
Nothing left to lose
"I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me"
"Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take"
"I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me"
"Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)"
"Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take"
"Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)"
Hope you never hear this
And know that it’s for you
I don’t know what I’d tell you if
You asked me for the truth
"I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me"
"Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)"
"Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take"
"Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)"
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
"I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me"
"Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)"
"Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take"
Now you were standing there right in front of me
I hold on its getting harder to breathe
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be
I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind its a picture of you
It lies there alone in its bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two
Ill keep my eyes wide open
Ill keep my arms wide open
"Dont let me, dont let me"
"Dont let me go, cause Im tired of feeling alone"
"Dont let me, dont let me go"
Cause Im tired of feeling alone

"I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh"
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand
"Ill keep my eyes wide open, yeah"
"Dont let me, dont let me"
"Dont let me go, cause Im tired of feeling alone"
"Dont let me, dont let me go"
"Dont let me, dont let me"
Dont let me go cause Im tired of feeling alone
"Dont let me, dont let me"
Dont let me go cause Im tired of feeling alone
"Dont let me, dont let me go"
"Mirror, mirror on the wall"
"Dont say it cause I know Im cute (Ooh, baby)"

"Hello, I’m Harry Styles, and tonight I’m going to help you drift off to sleep with some soothing words and calming music"
A sleep story just for you
"With all the business of your day, I know how hard it can be to go to sleep"
"So, thank you for choosing this story, and me, to help you"
I wish you a wonderful night sleep
"So make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath in, and then out"
"In, and then out"
"And when you’re ready, close your eyes"
"Have you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? When you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to look"
Tonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like
"So, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night"
Settle back and clear your mind
"We’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestial"
I’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars
"Which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are"
"As you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skies"
"Think about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above"
The power of the universe meanders through your mind
"So, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can find"
Let’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and I could dream about forever
"Imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palms"
A gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees
"We’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity"
"So, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinity"
Picture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew
"Inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you"
"Leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a stream"
"Dappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread"
The dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads
Occasionally they kiss our cheeks
Small pleasures; quenching needs
"Holding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook"
"Its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look"
A shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above
"The world we think but dare not speak, is L-O-V-E; love"
"Now, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours"
As willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers
"Gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass by"
"The wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross"
"For some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lost"
"Passing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow"
"A symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes"
Nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysers
"Strolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall"
Its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall
"The raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies"
Peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skies
"The fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing gift"
"Sheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down"
"But, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town"
"A gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blur"
"We find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake"
"All crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake"
"The scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones"
"As looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stones"
"The stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm"
"Herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deer"
Strands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky
"Mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly"
"In the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow"
The kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go
"Contemplating nothingness, a scene takes shape before us"
"And as it sharpens in our thoughts, we hear a distant chorus, the dampened sound of silence that only snow can bring, surrounds us with its calming vibes, and touches us within"
Glistening snowflakes fall in flurries
"Mountain rivers freeze, the powdery slopes look beautiful, and fresh snow dusts the trees"
"Somehow, now, we’re in a cabin, taking in this view as the fire crackles in the corner just for me and you"
"We linger for a moment, or maybe it’s been hours for when we blink and look again, our vistas waft in flowers"
"Another destination lulls us; closer now, it seems"
"Perhaps it’s real, or just another chapter in our dreams"
"Drifting in and out of sleep, our thoughts take us elsewhere, to an island fringed by swaying palms, lush beyond compare"
"A path winds through the mangroves towards a distant beach, that underlines the turquoise ocean"
"Now, within our reach"
"Eventually, we feel the powdery sand right beneath our feet"
"The sun above now blessing us with gentle, soothing heat"
"We hear the lilting sound of surf breaking up ahead, while spiral shells and pearly shards determine where we tread"
"Finally, a lapping wave engulfs our sandy feet"
"It seems to pause and ruminate, then gradually retreat"
"We dig our toes in cool, wet sand"
"Then, sit and face the sea and let the sound wash over us"
"Alone, just you and me"
"Staring at the nothingness that stretches on forever, our thoughts dovetail and unify in tune, two minds together"
"As minutes turn to hours, we drift off somewhere new and visualize a stairway to a door we now walk through"
Imagine now a meadow on a balmy afternoon
"Birds, and bees, and rustling trees create a summer tune, flanked by fields of sunflowers"
Hand-in-hand we walk as the gentle sound of nature surrounds us while we talk
"The sunflowers give the scenery a warm and golden hue, while hazy sunshine softens our idyllic, rustic view"
"As we roam past hedgerows, a farmhouse sits alone"
Its open shutters pressed against uneven walls of stone
A garden winds around the house and daisies poke through grass
A bench that’s lived through countless summers creeks as we walk past
"We wonder if the house is empty; once loved, but no longer"
The thought of passing time inspires a feeling that grows stronger
"This feeling washes over us, lost between a sight"
"And as the sun begins to set, we stop and wonder why gravity caresses us and pulls you close to me"
"Then, the scene begins to fade on new reality"
"Deeper, gradually deeper, we drift and now transcend to unfamiliar places"
Too surreal to comprehend
"Slowly, we capitulate, as sleep begins to call"
"Entwined in dreams and shifting scenes, we drift and gently fall"
"Friendly faces, glorious places, things we hope to do; intertwined with snapshots"
"Some of me, and some of you"
"Moonlit valleys, verdant forests, gazing at the ocean, summer meadows, tranquil sunsets, steeped in pure emotion"
"The tenderness we feel when we are close, two minds as one, surrounds us and connects us"
"But, we’ve only just begun"
"For now, we dream together of all that is to follow"
"And now that sleep will keep us safe, for now until tomorrow"
"Maybe all the memories that we’ve gathered here tonight are all dreams now remembered, or wishes in plain sight"
"No matter what, they’re with us now, for this night and forever"
"And every time we close our eyes, they’re yours and mine to treasure"
"Solo para tu llanto, es la señal de los tiempos"
Bienvenido al último show
Espero que lleves puesta tu mejor ropa
No puedes sobornar la entrada en tu camino al cielo
Te ves tan bonita aquí abajo
Pero no eres realmente buena
"Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes"
¿Porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
De las balas? de las balas?
"Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes"

De las balas? de las balas?
"Solo para tu llanto, es la señal de los tiempos"
Tenemos que escapar de aquí
Tenemos que escapar de aquí
"Solo para tu llanto, todo irá bien"
Ellos me dijeron que el final estaba cerca
Tenemos que escapar de aquí
"Solo para tu llanto, date el momento de tu vida"
Las cosas están bastante bien desde aquí
"Recuerda, toda estará bien"
Podremos vernos de nuevo en algún lugar
Algún lugar lejos de aquí
"Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes"
¿Porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
De las balas? de las balas?
"Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes"

¿Porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
De las balas? de las balas?
"No hablamos lo suficiente, deberíamos abrirnos más"
Antes de que sea demasiado
Nunca aprendemos? Ya hemos estado aquí antes
Es todo lo que sabemos
"Solo para tu llanto, es la señal de los tiempos"
"Tenemos que escapar, tenemos que escapar"
"Tenemos que escapar, tenemos que escapar"
"Tenemos que, tenemos que escapar"
"Tenemos que, tenemos que escapar"
Paved paradise and put up a parking lot
"With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin hot spot"
Dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone?
"Paved paradise, put up a parking lot"
"Took all the trees, put em in a tree museum"
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone?
"They paved paradise, put up a parking lot"
"Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now"
Give me spots on my apples
"But leave me the birds and the bees, please"
Dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone?
"Paved paradise, put up a parking lot"
"Paved paradise, put up a parking lot"
"Late last night, I heard the screen door slam"
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Dont it always seem to go

Less than one minute old
I never thought through love wed be
Making one as lovely as she
But isnt she lovely made from loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
"I took my love, I took it down"
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down
"Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?"
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
"Well, Ive been afraid of changing"
Cause Ive built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And Im getting older too
"Yes, Im getting older too"
"Well, Ive been afraid of changing"
Cause Ive built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And Im getting older too
"Yes, Im getting older too"
"Oh, take my love, take it down"
"Oh, climb a mountain and turn around"
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
"Well the landslide will bring it down, down"
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
"Well the landslide will bring it down, oh oh"
The landslide will bring it downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
I confess that I was lost before
The lights made me lose my direction
"My aching heart now riots, rules my actions"
"I sense your ignorance, voiceless,I cannot move on"
Dont let this love fall again down
I don’t wanna feel again like on a high rope
I adore getting grabbed by your attention
And Im desperate to feel your devotion
Be my umbrella in the burning rain
Catch my tears and keep me safe
I only want to feel pain when you agree with it
"You are my saviour, far from my enemy"
Dont let this love fall again down
I don’t wanna feel again like on a high rope
I adore getting grabbed by your attention
And Im desperate to feel your devotion
"And my love, when I hear your soft voice"
My spine is burning to ashes and the lust grows
"I wanna be real with you, baby"
Because youre making my life having goals
Dont let this love fall again down
I dont wanna feel again like on a high rope
I adore getting grabbed by your attention
"Youre insecure, dont know what for"
Youre turning heads when you walk through the door
Dont need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
"You dont know, oh oh, you dont know youre beautiful"
"So c-come on, you got it wrong"
To prove Im right I put it in a song
I dont know why youre being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
"You dont know, oh oh, you dont know youre beautiful"
If only you saw what I can see
Youll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now Im looking at you and I cant believe
"You dont know, you dont know youre beautiful"
"Nana nana nana nana, nana nana nana nana, nana nana nana nana"
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
"You dont know, you dont know youre beautiful"
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell

Youll understand why I want you so desperately

Whos that shadow holding me hostage?
Ive been here for days
Whos this whisper telling me that Im never gonna get away?
I know theyll be coming to find me soon
But I fear Im getting used to
Being held by you
"Oh, baby, look what youve done to me"
"Oh, baby, look what youve done now"
"Oh, baby, Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh"
"Oh, baby, look what youve done to me"
"Oh, baby, youve got me tied down"
"Oh, baby, Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh"
Whos this man thats holding your hand
And talking about your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now hes changed his mind
I know theyll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room
"Yeah, I fell for you"
"Oh, baby, look what youve done to me"
"Oh, baby, look what youve done now"
"Oh, baby, Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh"
"Oh, baby, look what youve done to me"
"Oh, baby, youve got me tied down"
"Oh, baby, Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh"
All my life Ive been on my own
I use the light to guide me home
But now together were alone
And theres no other place Id ever wanna go
"Baby, look what youve done"
(Look what youve done to me)
"Oh, baby, look what youve done to me"
"Oh, baby, look what youve done now"

You can have an airplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me

You could have a big dipper
"Going up and down, and around the bends"
"You could have a bumper car, bumping"
The amusement never ends

Let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony
Show me round your fruit cakes
Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruit cakes

"After the gold rush, there aint no reason to stay"
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys dont run away
But roads werent made to not go down
And there aint room for both of us in this town
"So you can have your space, cowboy"
I aint gonna fence you in
"Go on, ride away in your Silverado"
Ill see you around again
"Cause I know my place, and it aint with you"
"Sunsets fade, and love does, too"
We had our day in the sun
"When a horse wants to run, aint no sense in closing the gate"
So you can have your space
"You can have your space, cowboy"
I aint gonna fence you in
"Go on, ride away in your Silverado"
Ill see you around again
"Cause I know my place, and it aint with you"
"Sunsets fade, and love does, too"

"Baby, youll come knocking on my front door"
Same old line you used to use before
"I said yeah, well what am supposed to do?"
I didnt know what I was getting into
So youve had a little trouble in town
So youre keeping some demons down
"Stop draggin my, stop draggin my"
Stop draggin my heart around
And jts hard to think about what youve wanted
Its hard to think about what youve lost
Oo this doesnt have to be the big get even
This doesnt have to be anything at all
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl
"Baby, you could never look me in the eye"
"Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words"
"Stop draggin my, stop draggin my"
Stop draggin my heart around
Well theres people running round loose in the world
Aint got nothing better to do
Oo they make a meal of some bright-eyed kid
Oo you need someone looking after you
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl
"Baby, you could never look me in the eye"
"Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words"

Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
"Youre saying I’m fragile, I try not to be"
I search only for something I cant see
Cause I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won’t be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you wont be walking out the door
"Lovers forever, face to face"
"My city, your mountains"
"Stay with me, stay"
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew Id never want to leave
Sometimes Im a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow Id get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by
"Lovers forever, face to face"
"My city, your mountains"
"Stay with me, stay"
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
"Lovers forever, face to face"
"My city, your mountains"
"Stay with me, stay"
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Take from me my lace
Take from me my laceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Maestro, guide the bass"
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And Im just wondering
How to end the distance between
And Im acting like an angel underneath
"Even if I look like a fool, a devil"
I am a bad boy but for my girl a soft teen
Even if I passed the point of eighteen
"In the hallway, I reminisce"
"About the moments, you with me"
Kissing you under the starlight baby
"You with me, under the sheets"
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And Im just wondering
How to end the distance between
"After the rave party, I see"
"Reflections of you, out in the streets"
I cry baby but thats me
I love you more than you imagine
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And Im just wondering
How to end the distance between
"And even If Im far, youre still in my heart"
Printed forever like a pleasing scar
And at the midnight the stars
Angels of the insane real world
"Youre my secret Wonderland, oh oh"
I need to xertz the whole sea
To save you from drowning
"A striver to survive, yeah"
Preventing you from falling
My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And Im just wondering
How to end the distance between
How to end the space between?

A ja se zеzam s njim
I okej sam s tim

Reúnete conmigo en el pasillo
Reúnete conmigo en el pasillo
Acabo de dejar la habitación
Dame algo de morfina
¿Hay algo más que se pueda hacer?
"Solo házmelo saber, yo estaré a la puerta, a la puerta"
"Solo házmelo saber, yo estaré en el piso, en el piso"
Tal vez podamos resolverlo
"Tengo que mejorarme, tengo quе mejorar"
"Tengo que mеjorarme, tengo que mejorar"
"Tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar"
Y tal vez podamos resolverlo
Caminé por las calles todo el día
Corriendo con los ladrones
Porque me dejaste en el pasillo (Dame algo más)
Solo aleja el dolor
"Solo házmelo saber, yo estaré a la puerta, a la puerta"
"Solo házmelo saber, yo estaré en el piso, en el piso"
Tal vez podamos resolverlo
"Tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar"
"Tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar"
"Tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar"
Y tal vez podamos resolverlo
No hablamos sobre ello
Es algo que no hacemos
Porque una vez que lo dejas
No hay nada que pueda llenarteEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
Tuvimos otra charla sobre lo que está fallando
Pero todavía somos jóvenes
No sabemos a dónde vamos
Pero sabemos cuál es el lugar al que pertenecemos
Dos corazones en un hogar
Es difícil cuando discutimos
"Lo sé, pero oh"
"Dulce criatura, dulce criatura"
"Allá donde voy, tú me traes a casa"
"Dulce criatura, dulce criatura"
Cuando me quedo sin carretera
Tú me traes a casa
Corríamos cruzando el jardín
"Oh, donde nada nos molestaba"
Pero todavía somos jóvеnes
Yo siempre piеnso en ti
Y en cómo no hablamos lo suficiente
Dos corazones en un hogar
"Lo sé, es difícil, discutimos"
"Lo sé, pero oh"
"Dulce criatura, dulce criatura"
"Allá donde voy, tú me traes a casa"
"Dulce criatura, dulce criatura"
Cuando me quedo sin carretera
Tú me traes a casa

Solo detén tu llanto

Tadı çok güzel görüntüsü çok gerçek
Kulağa önceden hissettiğim bir şeymiş gibi geliyor
Ama gördüğüm şeye dokunamıyorum
Biz eski biz değiliz
Biz eski biz değiliz
Biz sadece kendi yerimize geçen iki hayaletiz
Kalbinin atmasının nasıl bir şey olduğunu hatırlamaya çalışıyoruz
Buzdolabının ışığı odayı beyaza bürüyor
Ay senin iyi tarafında dans ediyor
Ve bu eskiden bizim tüm ihtiyacımızdı
Sanki hiç tanışmamışız gibi dilimiz tutuldu
Zaten anlattığımız hikayeleri anlatıyoruz
Çünkü gerçekten kastettiğimiz şeyi söylemiyoruz

I jump into knee deep water
"But I’m sinking, somehow"
Trouble on every corner
But you’re all I need now
"You, you give me something"
What it is I just don’t know
But I feel like a time bomb ticking
And without you I might blow
You give me the feeling
You give me a hiding place
Our love is bitter
But I really like the taste
Who said it was easy
Taking it day by day
That I’ll love you anyway
You make it feel right

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
"You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake"
"You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint"
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
"I dont, but you still hit my phone up"
"And baby, Ill be movin on"
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
"And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on"
"But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own"
Cause if you like the way you look that much
"Oh baby, you should go and love yourself"
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
"I dont, but you still hit my phone up"
"And baby, Ill be movin on"
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
"And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on"
"But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own"
Cause if you like the way you look that much
"Oh baby, you should go and love yourself"
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
"I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all"
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
"Oh baby, you should go and love yourself"
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
"Oh baby, you should go and love yourself"
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
"You know I try, but I dont do too well with apologies"
"I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?"
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
"By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times"
"So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight"
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
Cause Im missing more than just your body
"Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?"
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
"Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth"
Can we both say the words and forget this?
"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
Cause Im missing more than just your body
"Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?"
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?

"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
"You know you love me, I know you care"
Just shout whenever and Ill be there
"You want my love, you want my heart"
"And we will never, ever, ever be apart"
"Are we an item? Girl, quit playin"
"Were just friends, what are you sayin?"
"Said ""Theres another,"" and looked right in my eyes"
"My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like"

When they dont even know that Im hurting
"Cause lifes not easy, Im not made out of steel"
"Dont forget that Im human, dont forget that Im real"
"Act like you know me, but you never will"
Theres one thing that I know for sure
"Ive got to learn things, learn them the hard way"
"Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say"
Sometimes its hard to do the right thing
When the pressures coming down like lightning
Its like they want me to be perfect
When they dont even know that Im hurting
"Cause lifes not easy, Im not made out of steel"
"Dont forget that Im human, dont forget that Im real"
"Act like you know me, but you never will"

"Mark my words, thats all that I have"
"Mark my words, give you all I got"
In every way I will
Youre the only reason why
Oh I dont wanna live a lie
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I wont let me lose you
And I wont let us just fade away
After all that weve been through
Ima show you more than I ever could say
"Mark my words, thats all that I have"
"Mark my words, give you all I got"
In every way I will
Youre the only reason why
Oh I dont wanna live a lie
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
"Come kiss me, silver and gold"
"You say that I wont lose you, but you cant predict the future"
So just hold on like you will never let go
"Yeah, if you ever move on without me"
I need to make sure you know that
"You are the only one Ill ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)"
"Yeah, you, if its not you, its not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)"
"Lookin back on my life, youre the only good Ive ever done (Ever done)"
"Yeah, you, if its not you, its not anyone (Anyone), not anyone"
Forevers not enough time to (Oh)
Love you the way that I want (Love you the way that I want)
"Cause every mornin, Ill find you (Oh)"
I fear the day that I dont
"You say that I wont lose you, but you cant predict the future"
Cause certain things are out of our control
"Yeah, if you ever move on without me"
I need to make sure you know that
"You are the only one Ill ever love (Only one, I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)"
"Yeah, you, if its not you, its not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)"

Feeling like Im breathing my last breath
Feeling like Im walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears Ive wept
Look at all the promises that Ive kept
I put my all into your hands
Heres my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
Youre not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That Ive ever known
You give me purpose
"Yeah, youve given me purpose"
Thinking my journeys come to an end
"Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace"
"Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?"
"Im more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirits at ease"
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
"No matter when, wherever I am"
Youre not hard to reach
And youve given me the best gift
That Ive ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way
"Oh, you are my everything"
"Oh, you are my everything"
"I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong"
But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again
We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
"You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are"
"You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do"
"If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening"
"If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go"
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
"Baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know"
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
"Swag swag swag, on you"
Chillin by the fire while we eating fondue
"I dunno about me, but I know about you"
"So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag"
I’d like to be everything you want

"Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend"
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
"Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and"
"Voice goin crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind"
I’d like to be everything you want

"Oh, my hearts a vacant house"
"When youre gone away, its so empty"
And love dont make sense when its empty (Oh no)

Less Im doing it with you
Time and time again I break a plan
"Without you, girl I aint the man"
Could never be all I can be
"You overstand, Im incomplete"
"Apparently, gotta know I hate that"
How Im supposed to take that?
"Bood up, missing all of that"
Gotta be laying in that
"Rolled up, put a flame to that"
Thought by now you would have made it back
Wont you pull up to me now?

"Oh-oh, whenever youre not in my presence"
"It feels like Im missing my blessings, yeah"
"So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night"
"Til youre back again, oh, yeah, yeah"
You think Im biased to my significant other
"You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover"

"You make me complete, youre all that matters to me"
"Take the gas out the car, it wont drive"
Thats how I feel when youre not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
"Oh-oh, Im grateful for your existence"
Faithful no matter the distance
Youre the only girl I see
"From the bottom of my heart, please believe"
"Youre all that matters to me, yeah, yeah"
Aint worried about nobody else
"If I aint with you, I aint myself"
You make me complete
"Youre all that matters to me, yeah, yeah"
"Whats a king, babe, without a queen?"
"There aint no ""I"" in team"
"You make me complete, youre all that matters to me"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Youre all that matters to me
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
Youre pulling me in like youre gravity
Im notorious for thinking youre full of beautiful
"Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill"
"Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow"
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
"Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth"
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
"In love with you, am I in love with you?"
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You give to me
"Everything, anything that I could dream"
And at least thats what it seems
Could it be I dont know whats good for me?
Im notorious for thinking youre full of beautiful
"Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill"
"Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow"
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
"Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth"
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
"In love with you, am I in love with you?"
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
Im standing on the borderline
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
"Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth"
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
"In love with you, am I in love with you?"
You aint gotta answer none of my calls
Im believing youll pick up one day
I dont wanna add to your pain at all
Im praying that time makes a change in your life
Im realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I dont wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Dont nobody deserve myself

You aint gotta make your mind up right now
"Right now, dont rush, no pressure"
You aint gotta make your mind up

"Calm down, dont rush, no pressure"
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought Id take you serious
"Now I need you, not a moment later"
"Losin it, Im so delirious"
And Ima put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
Im the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
"Right now, dont rush, no pressure"
You aint gotta make your mind up

Put my key in the ignition
"Dont rush it girl, just stretch it out for me"
I know that you ain’t got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
"Dont do it, baby"
"Dont do it to me, no, no"
"I know you dont wanna talk, right"
Weve been on and off like the cross lights
"You heard Im playin with them hoes like I golf, right?"
"When I touch you, I get frostbite"
"Girl youre so cold, so cold, so cold"
How we so young but livin so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin solo
That could drive you loco
"You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono"
"Oh no, round two again"
Weve been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
"I learned my lesson, I got straight As"
And I know its deeper than masseuses
"Oh, you know I eat the cookie like Im Lucious"
Go ahead and take the time
But its a waste of time if your waist aint on mine
You aint gotta make your mind up
(make your mind up)
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
"Dont rush, no pressure"
(there aint no pressure)
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now

"Dont rush, no pressure"
You aint gotta make your mind up

One touch and you got me stoned
Higher than Ive ever known
You call the shots and I follow
Sunrise but the nights still young
"No words, but we speak in tongues"
"If you let me, I might say too much"
Your touch blurred my vision
"Its your world, and Im just in it"
Even sober Im not thinkin straight
"Cause Im off my face, in love with you"
"Im out my head, so into you"
And I dont know how you do it
"But Im forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh"
Cant sleep cause Im way too buzzed
"Too late, now youre in my blood"
I dont hate the way you keep me up
Your touch blurred my vision

"Hold on tight, they hold on tight"
"Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight"
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Dont let this go to your head
But youre the best Ive ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
"Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock"
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
"Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh"
They hold on tight
"Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight"
Them lips wont let me go
"Lips wont let me go, lips wont let me go oh"
"Hold on tight, they hold on tight"
"Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight"
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where Id rather be instead
You dont know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
"Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot"
"With a turned up kind of loving, it just wont stop"
"No, so hard walking out"
"Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee"
They hold on tight
"Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight"
Them lips wont let me go

Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
"Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make"
"Im a fan and youre the rockstar, making it hard on me"
"Visualise a monster, cause youre too bad for me"
"Shot that arrow Im hit, need you right near me"
I try to maintain
"So dont mind if I turn away, no no"
I try to maintain

"Girl you dont know how I feel, how I really feel"
"Since you been away, oh baby"
Any chance that you could take my call? Take my call
"If I dialed you today, oh"
"Girl you say that you dont wanna talk, but its cool"
"Ive been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone"
Girl I know that I dont wanna lose your love
"Oh baby, oh baby"
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Dont tell me youre my heartbreaker
"Cause girl my hearts breaking, heartbreaker"
Dont tell me youre my heartbreaker
"Cause girl my hearts breaking, heartbreaker"
"Girl you see me standing here, standing here"
"Standing in the rain, oh baby"

And never go away?
"Girl you say that you dont wanna talk, but its cool"
"Ive been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone"

Dont tell me youre my heartbreaker
"Cause girl my hearts breaking, heartbreaker"
So what Im really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasnt been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
"Its just personal, this just, for me and you"
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
Im under this umbrella and Im calling your name
"And you know I dont wanna lose that, cause I still believe"
"I still believe in love, I still believe in us"
"I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you dont see"
"Cause what you dont see is when we dont speak I really dont sleep, I wanna talk to you"
And if Id have the world in my hands Id give it all to ya
"I wanna know if you feeling, the way that Im feeling"
"I wanna know if you feeling, the way that Im, the way that Im"
"And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart"
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
Its like youre stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it aint over
"Oh, even in the midst of doubt"
Life is worth living
"Life is worth living, so live another day"
The meaning of forgiveness
"People make mistakes, doesnt mean you have to give in"
Life is worth living again
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
"Cause my heart, its just that cold"
Skating on thin ice
But its strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
"He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last"
For that long journey ahead
Said it aint ever over
"Oh, even in the midst of doubt"
Life is worth living
"Life is worth living, so live another day"
The meaning of forgiveness
"People make mistakes, doesnt mean you have to give in"
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
"I aint perfect, wont deny"
My reputations on the line
So Im working on a better me
Life is worth living
"Life is worth living, so live another day"
The meaning of forgiveness
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
"Oh, you dont compare, dont fit in with em, do you get me?"
"Judgin by the way you open up, you get me"
"Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me"
"Lookin at the way were blendin in, you get me"
"Ha-ha-ha, you get me"
"Ha-ha-ha, you get me"
"See, youre lookin beyond the surface"
Can tell by the questions youre asking
You got me low-key nervous
"It feels like were on the same wave, yeah"
"Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?"
"Never thought Id connect with you, not in these circumstances"
"Oh, you dont compare, dont fit in with em, do you get me?"
"Judgin by the way you open up, you get me"
"Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me"
"Lookin at the way were blendin in, you get me"
"Ha-ha-ha, you get me"
"Ha-ha-ha, you get me"
"Ooh, theres so much chemistry"
"Like a chemist, how you finishin my sentences"
"In the center, no, we cant deny this energy"
How bout reapin all the benefits? Yeah
"Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?"
"Never thought Id connect with you, not in these circumstances, no"
"Oh, you dont compare, dont fit in with em, do you get me?"
"Judgin by the way you open up, you get me (Yeah, you really get me, ooh)"
"Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me (Ooh, thats where you send me)"
"Lookin at the way were blendin in, you get me (Ooh, you really get me)"
"Ha-ha-ha, you get me (Ooh)"
"Ha-ha-ha, you get me (Oh, oh)"
Sometimes I think I overthink (Think I)
And I start to feel anxiety (Anxie—)
There were times I couldnt even breathe (Mmm)
"But you never once abandoned me (No, you never, ooh)"
"I tried to scare you, scare you away"
"Showed you the door, you adored me anyway"
When I was broken in pieces
"You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind"
"Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved"
"Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable"
"Never judged, never judged"
Never judged me when I was unable
"To love myself, to trust myself"
"Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved"
"Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable"
White knuckles tryna hold my sanity (Hold my)
"Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh"
Never know when my minds gonna turn on me (Never know)
"But youre the one I call for security (Oh, baby)"
These memories have been toxic (Oh)
I tried to wean and get off it (Oh)
"Through everything, you been my rock"
I think youre the only thing I didnt get wrong
"Oh, I know God was listening"
Every night when I would pray
Youre an angel watchin over me (Oh)
"I tried to scare you, scare you away"
"Showed you the door, you adored me anyway"
When I was broken in pieces
"You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind"
"Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved"
"Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable"
"Never judged, never judged"
Never judged me when I was unable
"To love myself, to trust myself"
"Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved"
"Im here to stay, I aint going nowhere"
I know youre scared cause youve been hurt
Lost in your eyes every time that you look in mine
Promise to be all that you need
"I wont leave you, baby"
"No, cause I just wanna love you"
I will never ever put nobody up above you
"I just wanna kiss you, baby"
"I just wanna hug you til the end, baby, til the end"
"Cause Im right here, aint nobody gotta hold ya"
"Cause Im right here, aint nobody gon control ya"
"Cause Im right right here, yeah yeah"
"Im right here, Im right here, Im right here, Im right here, yeah"
"Im right here, Im right here, yeah"
"Im right here, Im right here, yeah"
"Say youll be mine, say well be fine, say well be together"
"Selfish of me to ask, since I be the reason we dont last forever"
Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need
"I wont leave you, baby"

Suns up and I still aint got no rest
"Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much"
"Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love"
"When I cant feel you, I feel out of touch"
Two seconds without yous like two months
"Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much"
"Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love"
Cause eternity with you aint long enough
Two seconds without yous like two months
And thats too much

You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truthll make us relevant
Hurts but its necessary
"Dont want us to lose what we are, no"
Dont want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
If it aint broke then we dont need to fix it
Believing in that she sayll have you livid
No they wont be happy til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you dont wanna get it
They aint never had your back like I got it
They ain’t never had trust like how we got it

They see what we got and you know they want it
You aint gotta question it

The truthll make us relevant
Hurts but its necessary
"Dont want us to lose what we are, no"
Dont want us to lose what we are

But there aint enough equations for you to solve em
So quick to turn nothin right into somethin

They ain’t ever had my back like you got it

"She texts me ""Hows you love life?"""
"And ""How are you?"", I said ""Im good"""
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
"Warm oceans, better weather"
Instead of us playing games forever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
"Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when Im home"
"Im serious girl, a much older dude, a whole"
"Ive accomplished my goals, its only you"
"You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape"
Just my Mets cap and my batch and Im straight

The truthll make us relevant
"Hurts but its necessary, yeah"
Dont want us to lose what we are
"(Dont wanna lose, no)"

Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Like a permanent stain
"Wishing I could just wash away, away"
Hate our love was in vein
But were the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
Id make us brand new
I never wanted to be
"Your enemy, no, no"
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Dwindle in my mind
Like a permanent stain
"Wishing I could just wash away, away"
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
Id make us brand new
I never wanted to be
"Your enemy, no, no"
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
Id make us brand new
I never wanted to be
"Your enemy, no, no"
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
"Lately Ive been thinking, thinking bout what we had"
"I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah"
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
"Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you"
Nothing can make me feel like you do
"You know there’s no one, I can relate to"
And know we won’t find a love that’s so true
"There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me"
Together through the storm
"There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me"
"I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give"
"Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah"
"Lost in confusion, like an illusion"
You know Im used to making your day
"But that is the past now, we didnt last now"
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see
"There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me"
Together through the storm
"There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me"
"There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me"
Together through the storm
"There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me"
Not sure what I was doing before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin like havin someone for you
Someone beside you when its time to lay down
"Fully committed, youre here for the stay down"
"Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown"
"Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door"
Open up my eyes to a feelin I cant ignore
I need you all around me
"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
I need you all around me
Wouldnt wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
Ill make sure youre comfortable
You make sure Im comfortable
I need you all around me
"All around me, yeah"
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anythings possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that Id ever been dealt
"Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door"
Open up my eyes to a feelin I cant ignore
"I need you all around me, yeah"
"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
I need you all around me
Wouldnt wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
Ill make sure youre comfortable
You make sure Im comfortable
I need you all around me
Feels like times moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I dont go looney over you (Ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
"To drown out all of this need for you (You, ooh)"
"Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious"
See its one oclock now
Noon felt like three hours ago
I just wanna know your E
"Out the window, got me looking out the street"
Distance only made us grow fonder
"Be honest, whats your E"
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Dont say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
"Love me hard like, ""Where you been?"""
Love me like you dont want it to end
I just wanna know your E
"Out the window, got me looking out the street"
Distance only made us grow fonder
"Be honest, whats your E"
Before you gotta go
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
"Thank you, yes, youre less than five minutes away from me"
"In your arms, rubbing on your face"
Only place I wanna be
"In the bed, where we lay our head"
I bought a castle in France and its the same one
I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
"But it turns out its just your room, just your room"
Id run off the end of the earth just to see if youd catch me
When I know youd let me fall every time
All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
"Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)"
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
"Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)"
I need to be loved by you (Oh)
I need to bе loved by you (Need to)
"I need to be loved by you (Need to, need to, need to)"
I need to bе loved by you
I remember when we started datin
The only ting that you and me was chasin
The kinda lovin that they couldnt play with
"You know my lovin is an every day ting, baby"
You and me in different places
Textin and messagin and talkin crazy
"When Im with you, I feel like its a daydream"
Thats how I know that you would always be my baby
All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
"Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)"
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
"Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)"
"I walk a thousand miles, Ive opened every door"
"Its not enough, its still your love Im always lookin for"
"Its just the way Im wired, whether Im wrong or right"
Ive only got one thing on my mind
I need to be loved by you
"I need to be loved by you (Need to, need to, need to, need to)"
I need to be loved by you (You)
"I need to be loved by you (Need to, need to, need to, need to)"
"Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh"
"Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh"
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Dont be afraid to stand alone
Dont be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know its hard away from home
And it aint easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin to your significant other all night long
"Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh"
"Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh"
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Shouldve been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now youre standin right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
"Hope your heart has started healing, oh"
"Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh"
"Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh"
"Across the ocean, across the sea"
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
"Over the mountains, across the sky"
"Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes"
Through the storm and through the clouds
"Bumps in the road, and upside down now"
I know its hard to be asleep at night
"Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright"
Through the sorrow and the fights
"Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright"
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
"For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles"
To be in your arms holding my heart
"Oh I, oh I, I love you"
And everythings gonna be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
"Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright"
You know that I care for you
Ill always be there for you
I promise Ill just stay right here
I know that you want me too
"Baby, we can make it through anything"
Cause everythings gonna be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
"Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright"
Through the sorrow and the fights
"Try to bite my tongue, but I cant take it"
I got whiplash from me turnin my head
"Have somewhere else to go, no, I cant make it"
Id rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

All I wanna do is greet ya

"You got the keys to my city (Ooh), like, ""La, la, la, la"" (Straight up)"
"Do you second that emotion, baby? (Ah, yeah)"
Out to big boys (Its lit)
"Spring her off the hitch (Yeah), everything legit"
"Movin like the blitz (Blitz), crib like the Ritz (Like the Ritz)"
So you know theres room (Skrrt)
"(Hold up, nah, nah, nah, that was the first time she did that)"
"Dont like to talk to bitch (Yeah), just like to play the wish"
I know the problem is they bothered by the kid (Im tryna pop another one in)
"Oh, you sent the jet out for me?"
You tryna ball harder than me?
Did I come cross your radar?
Cross your mind now and later?
Do you feel like you know me?
Its just a part of nature
Lets ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor? Baby
"Try to bite my tongue, but I cant take it (Ooh-wee)"
"I got whiplash from me turnin my head (Hey, hey, hey)"
"Have somewhere else to go, no, I cant make it (Ooh-wee)"
Id rather take my chance with you instead

When Im in my thoughts sometimes
Its hard to believe Im the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
Im on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred nine and it slipped my hands
But this the one Im not givin up
Night after night you fall asleep on me
Im prayin that I dont go back to who I was
I feel like I dont deserve you tonight (Tonight)
Its in the way that you hold me
I dont deserve you tonight (Tonight)
Its in the things that you show me (Show me)
"I need you, dont let me go"
"Need you, dont let me go"
"I feel like I dont de-, I dont de-, I dont deserve you tonight"
I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
"Cause you could think it might be too much, oh yeah"
I dont wanna be my past
"Oh, when we kiss, Im alive and I feel brand new"
Theres nothing that I want more than us (Na-na-na-na-na)
"Night after night, you fall asleep on me (Sleep on me)"
"Im prayin that I dont go back to who I was (Oh no, no no, no)"

Somewhere in the sky (Yeah)

And when you give in to me

And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah)
As you dance around the room (Yeah)

"Like you, you, like you"
"Misery, misery loves company"
Dont let em change your mood

They tryna tell me that Im just like the others
But I aint all bad

"Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be"
"To you to you, to you"
"Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy"
Thats what they do
"They try to get at me, they try to get at me"

They tryna tell me that Im just like the others
But I aint all bad
"No, no I aint all bad, all bad, all bad"
"I aint that bad, all bad all bad"
"I might make you mad, so mad, my bad"
Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
Thats where our hearts were safe
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
"Oh, in every visit"
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay
So get used to me checking in
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face

"Oh counting down, its almost Christmas Eve"
Oh seven days shy of New Years Eve
Then well be celebrating
So get used to me checking in
Get used to me falling through

"Baby, I like your style"
Lips on your neck
Were never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I dont know your name
But Im sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
"Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed"
And youre all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
"And when this song comes on, you know"
I need a one dance

One more time fore I go
"Body lockin, put a hold on me"

"First, Ill acknowledge, all trust has been broken"
"A successful recovery, I pray for us at night"
"Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again"
"Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right"
"Make it right, make it right"
"Make it right, this time Ill do you right, woah"
"Im missing your good intentions, Im missing you from a distance"
Hope you did the same
"I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid"
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie cause I don’t wanna see you cry
"Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, Imma hold it back inside"
"Well now that Im back around ya, nothing else really matters"
Hope you feel the same
"First, Ill acknowledge, all trust has been broken"
"A successful recovery, I pray for us at night"
"Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again"
"Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right"
"Make it right, make it right"
"Make it right, this time Ill do you right, woah"
"Im going through old emotions, tryna find a reason"
That we ended that way
"Nothing in life is perfect, well be changing like the seasons"
Thats what they used to say
"If its going to sleep alone at night, I don’t wanna close my eyes"
"Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time"
"Well now that Im back around ya, nothing around me matters"
Hope you feel the same
"First, Ill acknowledge, all trust has been broken"
"A successful recovery, I pray for us at night"

"Woah oh baby, yeah yeah"
If I believe in love

"Then we could be in love, somehow"
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
"Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?"
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
"Lets be strong enough to endure, oh"
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
"Then we can be in love, somehow"
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
"Some people separate, yeah"
Don’t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
"That’s what we oughta do, yeah"
"Yeah, sometimes the heart can see"
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
"Giving up is immature, oh"
"We got so much more to live for, oh"
"They don’t wanna see us together now, oh"
"Lets be strong enough to endure, oh"
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
"Then we can be in love, somehow"
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Trust me right now
Oh we gotta learn to trust now
Girl you gotta learn to trust me now
If I believe in love like you believe in love
Then we could be in love
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
Aint nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now (One more time)
Aint nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Aint no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud
Quit acting like were in a race
"Beggin me, you know Im on the way over"
Take a moment to cherish this space
"So quick to move forward, no pressure"
And we got the rest
"Got the rest, got the rest of our lives"
We got the rest
"Got the rest, got the rest of our lives"
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
We got the rest
"Got the rest, got the rest of our lives"
Look at how its all unfolding
"Yeah, persistence at its finest"
Like you wanted in before the door was open
Instead of lettin whats scripted play out
Quit acting like were in a race
"Beggin me, you know Im on the way over"
Take a moment to cherish this space
"So quick to move forward, no pressure"
"And weve got the rest (Hey, hey)"
"Got the rest, got the rest of our lives"
We got the rest (Oh-ooh)
"Got the rest, got the rest of our lives"
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
"Yeah, weve got the rest"
"Got the rest, got the rest of our lives"
"Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba"
Shes a stranger to the night shift
The type of girl you only dream about
"I was lost under the lights, yeah (Yeah)"
"An angel in the flames, she pulled me out"
Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
"Ima tell her in every kind of way (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)"
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you
"Yeah, I would die for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"Pain and passion, my desire"
Youre the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
"I would die for you (Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba)"
Shes a danger to the mindset
Displaced and stretched it out in every way
"Crossin every line, yeah"
T-T-Touch base until you find the chemistry
And I know this aint rocket science
And I never leave the house
Without checkin on you first
And begin to wonder
Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
"Ima tell her in every kind of way (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)"
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you
"Yeah, I would die for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"Pain and passion, my desire"
Youre the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
"Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die"
"Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die"
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you (I would die for you)
"Yeah, I would die for you (I would die for you, baby)"
"Pain and passion, my desire"
Youre the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
"When shes around, he feels nothing but joy"
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
"Youre the smile on my face, and I aint going nowhere"
"Im here to make you happy, Im here to see you smile"
Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love"
"But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall"
"Well, I can tell youre afraid of what this might do"
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose
Well I dont wanna lose it either
"And I dont think I can stand sitting around while youre hurting babe, so take my hand"
"Well, did you know youre an angel who forgot how to fly?"
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
"Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, Im the shoulder youre crying on"
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song Ill have figured out
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)"
"But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall"
"I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall"
"But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me"
But you cant fly unless you let your
You can’t fly unless you let yourself fall
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)"
"But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall"
Whats gonna make you fall in love? (in love)
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Dont have to be scared at all (dont have to be scared, dont have to be scared)"
"But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall"
"I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall"
I will catch you if you fall
"But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me"
"From the beginning, it was ending"
We were emotionally pending
Got all the questions to my answers
Keep runnin over me with your lovin
Im only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin over me with your lovin
Lookin like its turnin into something
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
"You just said, ""Hello,"" I lost my sanity"
Thought you was lookin through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
"Look out, watch out, got me on the defense"
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
"Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance"
Everything was in divine sequence
Keep runnin over me with your lovin
Im only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin over me with your lovin
Lookin like its turnin into something
"Better that than turnin into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)"
"Aint no interruptin this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)"
I believe in love
"Girl, you got my hopes all up"
"When I left you, when I met you"
I called mom and told her bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin down for hours
"I got back to and you started lookin young, so I stopped (Ooh)"
"Post intercourse when you walk by (Ass, ass, ass)"
More buns than a Shop Rite (Woah)
And you wanna sleep over my crib?
"Let me go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (Soft tee)"
What are our kids gonna be like? (Hmm)
What is your skin routine like?
"Girl, just run around bed with me"
Ill flirt with you all cleverly
"Ill lock you down, Pat Beverley"
"Ill kiss your breasts all tenderly, whats up? (Breast)"
How you so hot and cute? (How?)
I wanna make a language up with you
"Youre already drivin me crazy, so just"
Keep runnin over me with your lovin
Im only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin over me with your lovin
Lookin like its turnin into something
"Better that than turnin into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)"
"Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God"
And Im so damn grateful cause you make up for the things Im not
Didnt know I needed nothin til I needed you (Til I needed you)
"In a world thats spinnin, it aint easy lettin go"
"Eight billion people, we just lookin for a hand to hold"
Everybodys tryna find someone to hold on to (Hold on to)
"Its okay, its okay"
We all try to pretend that were brave
"When Im weak, yeah, Im strong"
Cause of you at the end of the day
Everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that youre not alone
Who gon defend you likе an army (Gon defend you like an army)
And nеver let go (Never let go)
"Yeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)"
Somebody to wake up to when everyones gone
"So if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)"
Ill be the shoulder you cry on
"Every time I look at you, Im lookin at a star"
Its the way you light up every room just bein who you are
"Didnt know I needed nothin til I needed you (Til I needed you, oh woah)"
"Look, before I met you, I never believed in magic"
But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it
"I know (Yeah, yeah) that you know (Yeah, yeah)"
"What we got, it dont come easy"
"Its okay, its okay"
We all try to pretend that were brave
"When Im weak, yeah, Im strong"
Cause of you at the end of the day
Everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that youre not alone
Who gon defend you like an army (Gon defend you like an army)
And never let go (Never let go)
"Yeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)"
Somebody to wake up to when everyones gone
"So if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)"
Ill be the shoulder you cry on
What do you mean its not like that?
"Well, where are you now that I need you?"
"But girl, let me tell you something"
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldnt reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldnt reach my love
I know when that hotline bling
Im sure Im not your only fling
I know when that hotline bling
Im sure Im not your only fling
Every time I leave the city you
Been hangin out with him like I dont know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin him that we dont even talk no more
"Every time he leave the city, you"
Try to run game on me like its just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
"When you hit my line, it dont mean that much"
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldnt reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldnt reach my love
I know when that hotline blings
Sure Im not your only flame
I know when that hotline blings
Sure Im not your only flame
"Every time I leave the city you, you, you"
Tell me where he like to shop when youre up under him
Said youre lyin bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein absent
"And I really tried taking you serious baby, it’s really your loss"
You had the chance being the only girl livin in my heart and cross
"Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost"
Would I double cross?
We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone
Cause you dont really care about my love
Call me on that hotline bling
If you wanna be with me
"Call me on that hotline bling, right now"
What about the children?
Look at all the children we can change
What about a vision?
Be a visionary for a change
Whos gonna be the one to fight for it?
Do you believe enough to die for it?
Whos got the heart? Whos got it?
Whose heart is the biggest?
Wear it on your sleeve
Bet we can make a difference

You just be honest with me
I know we can make this work
"I know that you afraid, babe"
"But you dont need to be saved, babe"
You just need someone who understands
"And I think I need the same, babe"
"Show me where you at, lets keep it honest"
Home is where you at and thats a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
"Nothing left between us, baby, nothing"
"Tell me what you want, lets keep it gangsta"
"Tell me who created you, Id thank her"
Open up and never keep it from us
"Nothing left between us, baby"
Hopefully youll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you
"I wanna dream what you dream, go where youre going"
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
"I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul"
"The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you"
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you
"Tell me what you want, I cant believe it"
I know that if we make it theres a reason
"Sometimes the sun shines, baby"
Sometimes it aint breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
"I told you Imma make it, that commitment"
"Yeah, you took your shot and didnt miss it"
Aint nothing more attractive than ambition
Hopefully youll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you
"I wanna dream what you dream, go where youre going"
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
"I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul"
"The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you"
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you
"If I came to your crib, would you open the door?"
"I dont wanna go down that road, no more"
"Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more"
"Youre the only one I wanna be with, yeah, yeah yeah"
"I wanna dream what you dream, go where youre going"
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
"I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul"
"The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you"
I only wanna live it with you
Dont do nothin less your hearts in it
"Hearts in it, hearts in it"
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
"All in it, all in it"
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
"The times you got back up, woah"
Could be a billionaire in a year
Thats how you gotta think til youre there
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
"Gotta go hard, yeah"
Thats all Im condoning
Love is a component
You’re the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
And dont do nothin less your hearts in it
"Hearts in it, hearts in it"
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
"All in it, all in it"
Come again each time
Til the water runs dry
Oh dont do nothin less youre all in it
"All in it, all in it"
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
If I had a guitar missing strings
A guitar with only one string
"I could only play one song, ooh"
Simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing
You know what I mean
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
"Gotta go hard, yeah"
Thats all Im condoning
Love is a component
Youre the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
And dont do nothin less your hearts in it
"Hearts in it, hearts in it"
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
"All in it, all in it"
Come again each time
Til the water runs dry
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
"All in it, all in it"
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
"All in it, all in it"
"See, growing up, I"
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
"Cause I, I just didnt think I was good enough"
"And, and maybe if I was good at something that Id get recognition from that but"
I quickly found out that I wasnt gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people arent perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God its like hes perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
I dont work harder when its easy
I put in work when its hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And Im not just sprung
Im not afraid to tell you that youre the one
The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when Im feeling down
Life is all good when youre around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
Because Ill take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
Because you dont come with drama
So I want you til the world ends
Youre way more than worth it
But I dont feel like I deserve it
"You got the pieces, youre my kind of perfect"
I dont work hard when its easy
I put in work when its hard
And girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season and Im not just sprung
"Im not afraid to tell you, that youre the one"
Im the one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when Im feeling down
Life is all good when youre around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
Because Ill take you home to mama
Ill let you meet my friends
Because you dont come with drama
So I want you til the world ends
Youre way more than worth it
And I dont feel like I deserve it
"You got the pieces, youre my kind of perfect"
My friends say Im a fool to think that youre the one for me
I guess Im just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know Im never leaving
Cause youre my angel sent from above
"Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours"
"Give you little more because I love ya, love ya"
"With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here"
"I promise my dear Ill put nothing above ya, above ya"
"Love me, love me, say that you love me"
"Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me"
"Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me"
"Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me"
"Love me, love me, say that ya love me"
"Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me"
"Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me"
"Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me"
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
Cause they dont get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
"A thousand days without your love, oh your love"
"Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours"
"Give you little more because I love ya, love ya"
"With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here"
"I promise my dear Ill put nothing above ya, above ya"
"Love me, love me, say that you love me"
"Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me"
"Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me"
"Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me"
"Love me, love me, say that ya love me"
"Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me"
"Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me"
"Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me"
My heart is blind but I dont care
Cause when Im with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold ya near
"I never want to let ya go, oh"
"Love me, love me, say that you love me"
"Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me"

"Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me"
"Love me, love me, say that ya love me"
"Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me"
"Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me"
All I care about is money and the city that Im from
"Imma sing until I feel it, Imma go until it’s done"
I don’t need to say wassup and my excuse is that Im young
"And Im only getting older, somebody shoulda told you"
"You know Im on one, yeah"
I said Im on one
"You know, Im on one"
"Two white cups and I got that drink, it could be purple, it could be pink"
"Depending on how you mix that ish, money that we got, never get that ish"
"Cause Im on one, yeah"
"You know Im one one, yeah yeah"
You know what I like

Cause youre the only one cause I dont trust these women
"I dont, I dont trust these women cause they might have me slipping"
Youre the only one
I dont trust these women cause they might have me slipping
Cause youre the only one cause I dont trust these women

Cause youre the only one
"Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues"
"Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah"
"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"(Oh yeah, lets call up one drink and lets all get wasted"
"One drink and lets all get faded, yeah)"
"Drizzy Drake, check me out"
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
"Kick game, run game, run it real good"
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like its somebody you dont know
"Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends"
When you got a bunch of feelings that you dont show?
"I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people dont like me no more"
"New shit dont excite me no more, guess that they dont really make em like me no more"
You can look me in my eyes and see I aint myself
Cause if yall what I created then I hate myself
"But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones"
On the table where we see them
"Im all day with it man, A"
M to the P
"Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, thats that ish that drives me crazy"
And thats all Ive been getting lately
And its probably why Im scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like theyre me and Im them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you
"Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues"
"Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah"
"Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah"
Lets call up one drink and lets all get wasted
"One drink and lets all get faded, yeah"
"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
It’s been hours since the crash
A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
"Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here"
There were other lifeforms in the ship
"There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens"
You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythms on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone
"You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive"
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
"I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck"
But you gotta listen
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
"You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever"
Stay in your backpack
Before you came around I was in a rut
"Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was"
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me
"You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive"
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
"I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck"
But you gotta listen
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
"You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever"
Stay in your backpack
"Greetings, I fell from the sky"
I’m from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
"And our flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived"
I’ve only taking over this planet since I arrived
"I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black"
"Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world"
"Different galaxy, they try to capture me"
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
"Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here"
We found this but no one can identify it
"There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens"
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
"You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever"
Stay in your backpack
In our planet we dont kill one another
We dont take love for granted
Its a gift from the mother and
"In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief"
"Thinkin ’bout you, it aint always bout me"
Don’t make any sense in you bein lonely
"Hurry up and get here now, but dont speed"
Ill never get over you up under me
"Oh, yes, I am (Yeah-yeah)"
"Yeah, for you, I am"
Dont mean to sound desperate

Nothin like your hands on me
Regret the moments that they’re off me and let it sink in
"Hear me talkin, dont ignore me"
"I was just about to call it, what you thinkin?"
"Been thinkin’ bout you, cant get this vision out my head"
"Got a grip, Im holdin onto every thing you say"
Aint makin this up just to get you in my bed
"If you aint left, yeah, you can go ahead"
"Thinkin bout you, it aint always bout me"
Dont make any sense in you bein lonely
"Hurry up and get here now, but dont speed"
Ill never get over you up under me
"Oh, yes, I am (Yeah-yeah)"
"Yeah, for you, I am"
Dont mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
I get frustrated when youre busy
"Lately, thats been more than often, baby, what is this?"
"Its like, do you even miss me?"
"Feelin less than priority, you got me convinced"
"Convinced Im the only one, trippin in my head"
"Because in reality, you live in my bed"
Im supposed to hold onto everything you said
"Yes or no question, dont leave it unread"
Are you available (Yeah-yeah) now?
"Oh, here I am, (Yeah-yeah) oh, here I am"
Are you available? (Yeah-yeah)
"Just tell me, ""Yeah"""
"Cause for you, I am"
You know I am
Dont mean to sound desperate

Are you available (Yeah-yeah)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
"Oh, darlin, theres not much that you can say"
To stop me from fallin in like I am
"Oh, darlin, even waves cant wash away"
"Our names in the sand, never could, never can"
"You are my everything, Id give up everything"
"Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I aint gonna run"
"Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah"
"They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know youre the one"
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
"All that I lеarned, it wasnt my turn, it wasnt the right time"
Somе people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
"But, baby, you are a lifetime"
"Oh, darlin, theres no word that can describe"
"The way that I feel, tonight"
"Oh, darlin, I would walk that broken road"
Time and time again if it led me to your hello
"You are my everything, Id give up everything"
"Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I aint gonna run"
"Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah"
"They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know youre the one"
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
"All that I learned, it wasnt my turn, it wasnt the right time"
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
"But, baby, you are a lifetime"
"Ooh, and I can feel you"
Even though I havent touched you
"Yeah, thats what love is"
Thats what true love is
Wouldnt want nobody else by my side
"Ooh, and you can trust me"
After all the lies I told you
"Yeah, thats what love is"
Thats what true love is
Dont nobody else deserve my time
"I reach out to you, but my hands cant hold enough"
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide
Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
"Hey, its a blessing that youre in my life"
Make me look even better
"When we shine, we shine together"
"Yeah, thats what love is"
"Now, thats what love is"
Dont nobody else deserve my eyes
"When you demand my presence, its hard to read the message"
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
Til you put it in perspective
Cant help but to respect it
"Oh, now I know what love is"
I know what true love is
"Yeah, down in my soul"
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
"You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah"
"Ooh, and I can feel you"
Even though I havent touched you
"Yeah, thats what love is"
"Now, thats what love is"
"Wouldnt want nobody else by my side, no"
"Thats what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)"
"Thats what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)"
"I appreciate you (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)"
"God bless your maker, hey-hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)"
"Thats what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)"
"Thats what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)"
Pop star Justin Bieber

"Maria, why you wanna do me like that?"
"That aint my baby, that aint my girl"
"Maria, why you wanna play me like that?"

"That aint my baby, that aint my girl"
"Maria, why you wanna play me like that?"

Theres no sophistication in my lack of patience
Im just wishing you were better at communication

"I already got ahead-y of the game, Im with Kenny"
"And we steady getting many, I mean money"
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses
I thanked Jesus at the awards Im never going to hell
"Call me Zack Morris, Im saving you by the bell"
My girl says Im perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally I think she is perfectly perfect

I swear I got a hun of these cause baby Im a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny

Possibly youre probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
"Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally"
Theres a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
"I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me"
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Cant you see the private jets flying over you?
I aint even notice but my focus on my photos
"Might be bogus, no they shouldnt be a photoshoot"
Its funny how you wanna take my picture and its like your first time
"Playing with camera claiming that ""Its not mine"""
"Just calm down, you dont gotta hurry"
"Dont be nervous, you dont gotta worry"
"Hey, whats the situation? Woah"
Im just tryna make a little conversation
Why the hesitation? Woah
"Tell me what your name is, for your information"
"Dont get me wrong, you know youre right"
"Dont be so cold, we could be fire"
"Tomorrow well go, lets start tonight"
"You know what its all about, woah"
"I could take you out, I could take you home"

"I could take you, oh, where you wanna go"
"I could pick it up, we could take it slow"

"I might have a reputation, woah"
But theres only me and you in this equation
"I promise this occasion, woah"
"Is a different situation, for your information"

The ocean we lay in makes it hard to think (Ooh)
Our spirits combine and its a basic instinct
"Your love is free-spoken, not written in ink (Ohh woah)"
Your intentions are obvious (Obvious)
Your affections miraculous (I cherish your touch)
"Every promise you make, you keep (Ooh)"
Never met nobody else like this

"Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum"
"A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum"
"Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum"
"To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum"
"Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum"
"Yeah, Im on the drum, yeah, Im on the snare drum"
"Yeah, Im on the beat cause the beat goes dumb"
And I only spit heat cause Im playing for the Son
"Playing for the king, playing for the title"
Im surprised you didnt hear this in the Bible
Im so tight I might go psycho
"Christmas time, so heres a recital"
"Im so bad like Michael, I know"
"Im still young, but I go, I go"
"Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid"
"Im the drummer boy, so do it, do it"
"Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)"
"I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum"
(Lets gather round the mistletoe real quick)
"I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum"
"(Matter fact, lets gather round the fireplace, its about to get hot in here)"
"Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum"
(Ima needa get straight to it)
"Yo, at the table with the family, havin dinner"
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
"Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers"
"Sippin eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla"
"Even though its kinda cold, Im pullin out a chinchilla"
"Bieber hit me back and said, ""Lets make it hot up in the winter"", I said ""Cool"""
You know Ima deliver
Lets collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
"Before we work, I gotta get this off"
See the other family members and drop gifts off

"Its crazy how some people say they, say they dont care"
"When theres people on the street with no food, its not fair"
Its about time for you to act merrily
Its about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
Cause theyre warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin theres a family out hungry and cold
"Wishin, wishin that they had somebody they could hold"
So I think some of you need to act bold
"Give a can to a drive, lets change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe"
"Im the drummer boy so do it, do it"
"Im the drummer boy so do it, do it"
"Im the drummer boy so do it, do it"
"Im the drummer boy so do it, do it"
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
"I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?"
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
"So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight"
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Quisiera regresar el tiempo y cambiar errores
Se que todo fue mi culpa y te cause dolores
Espero que de volver tu tengas intenciones
Por que hoy estoy aquí extrañándote
"Okay, tu por mi morias ma"
"No solo física, había química"
Yo te llamaba y no querias contestar
Se que fui tonto y no te supe valorar
Entiende mi estilo de vida
Por favor comprende que esto no paso de repente
Si esta en mi manos no lo dejo a la suerte
Solo espero que me perdones
"Nena, tengo tantas ganas de amarte"
Solo quiero que me perdones
Si tu y yo no podemos estar
"Olvida todo, no voy a fallar"

Right leg crossed while youre smokin a cigarette

Im overboard and I need your love to pull me up
"I cant swim on my own, its too much"
Feels like Im drowning without your love
"So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver"
"Oh, its supposed to be some give and take, I know"
But youre only taking and not giving anymore
So what do I do? Cause I still love you
And youre the only one who can save me
Im overboard and I need your love to pull me up
"I cant swim on my own, its too much"
Feels like Im drowning without your love
"So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver"
"Life saver, oh, life saver, oh"
"Life saver, oh, life saver, oh"
"Life saver, oh, life saver, oh"
"Life saver, oh, life saver, oh"
Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And its crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
"Could this be happening to me, yeah?"
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I cant find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?
Could it be a possibility?
Im tryna see whats up
"Its been me for you, and you for me"
Maybe now is time for us
"Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough"
"They say were too young for love, but Im catching feelings"
"In my head, were already together"
"Im good alone, but with you Im better"
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and Ill be right there
I aint never going nowhere
Im just tryna see where this can take us
"Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious"
I think I finally got it down
And all thats left to do now is get out the mirror
"And say it to her, yeah"
Could it be a possibility?
Im tryna see whats up
"Its been me for you, and you for me"
Maybe now is time for us
"Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough"
"They say were too young for love, but Im catching feelings"
Should I tell her how I really feel?
Should I move in close or just be still?
How will I know?
"Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?"
"How do I know, if she feels the same, oh?"
Could it be a possibility?
Im tryna see whats up
"Its been me for you, and you for me"
Maybe now is time for us
"Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough"
"They say were too young for love, but Im catching feelings"
Youre making promises to someone elses face
"If those should break, call out my name"
Youre getting high off of some new life that you made
"If that high fades, call out my name"
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line
At your best friends house
Were only getting better at pretending were okay
"And after all this time, we feel the same"
Cards on the table that we never got to play
"Oh, what a shame, call out my name"
"I bet hes cool, but I put fire in your veins"
"If you miss that flame, call out my name"
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line
At your best friends house
Were only getting better at pretending were okay
And after all this time
I know you think about laying side by side
"On the goodwill couch (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)"
Going line for line (Going line for line)
At your best friends house
Were only getting better at pretending were okay (Yeah)
"And after all this time, we feel the same"
"Love me like you do, love me like you do"
"Like you do, hold me tight and dont let go"
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
"Like you do, hold me tight and dont let go"
"Baby, baby, baby, teach me, teach me, teach me"
"Show me, show me, show me the way to your heart"

"Cause when you love me, I can feel it"
"When your heart beats, I can hear it"

"Hop up in them bed, baby, if youre trying to snooze"

I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

"I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?"
To keep you warm

And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying

Theres a dream that Ive been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand that its meant to be

"Its in the papers, its on the TV, its everywhere that I go"
"Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people dont have a home"
But I know theres sunshine behind that rain
I know theres good times beyond that pain
"Hey, can you tell me"
How I can make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day

I never thought that itd be easy
Cause we both so distant now
"And the walls are closing in on us, and were wondering how"
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
"And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart"
So we fight through the hurt
"And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry"
Then we live and we learn
"And we try, and try, and try, and try"
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
"Down to earth, down to earth"
On our way back down to earth
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
"And mommy, you were always somewhere"
"And daddy, I live out of town"
"So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?"
You tell me this is for the best
"So tell me, why am I in tears?"
"Woah, so far away and now I just need you here"
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
"Down to earth, down to earth"
On our way back down to earth
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
"Back down to earth, back down to earth"
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now were standing and where do we go?
When theres no road to get to your heart
Lets start over again
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
"Down to earth, down to earth"
On our way back down to earth
I never thought that itd be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
"Oh no, oh no babe"
I said last time was the last time that I messed up again
Am I addicted to losing?
"Promised I wouldnt lie, but I went and lied, girl I fed up again"

"Your world is my world, yeah"
Aint no way youre ever gon get any less than you should
"You smile, I smile, oh"
"Cause whenever you smile, I smile"
"Your lips, my biggest weakness"
Shouldnt have let you know
"Im always gonna do what they say, hey"
"If you need me, Ill come running from a thousand miles away"
"When you smile, I smile"
"You smile, I smile, hey"
"Baby, take my open heart and all it offers"
Cause this is as unconditional as itll ever get
You aint seen nothing yet
I wont ever hesitate to give you more
"Cause baby, you smile, I smile, whoa"
"You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey"
"You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile"
"You smile, I smile, make me smile, baby"
"Baby, you wont ever want for nothing"
You are my ends and my means now
"With you theres no in between, Im all in"

"But I fold to your wish cause its my command, hey hey hey"
"You smile, I smile, whoa"
"You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey"
"You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile"
"You smile, I smile, oh"
"You smile, I smile"
"I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you arent fit to live"
You may be years old as I happen to be
And one day some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
"Some great issue, some great cause"
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
Youre afraid that you will lose your job
Or youre afraid that you will bе criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or youre afraid that somеbody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
"Well, you may go on and live until you are"
But youre just as dead at as you would be at
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
"With you, with you"
"I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place"
"Now, Romeo and Juliet"
Bet they never felt the way we felt
"Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do"
You and I both know it cant work
Its all fun and games til someone gets hurt
"And I dont, I wont let that be you"
"Now you dont want to let go, and I dont want to let you know"
That there might be something real between us two
"Now we dont want to fall, but were tripping in our hearts"
And its reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you cant love me here
"I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place"
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause Im still stuck in the moment with you
"See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny"
"Like Sonny and Cher, I dont care, Ive got you baby"
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause aint no way its going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop
"Now you dont want to let go, and I dont want to let you know"
There might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
"Now we dont want to fall, but were tripping in our hearts"
And its reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you cant love me here
"I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place"
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause Im still stuck in the moment with you
"See like just because this cold, cruel world saying we cant be"
"Baby, we both have the right to disagree"
And I aint with it
"And I dont want to be so old and grey, reminiscing about these better days"
But conventions telling us to let go
So well never know
"I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place"
"Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah"
"I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place"
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
"Yeah, its not easy growin up"
"Only two years old, I was playin drums on the table"
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
"When I was young, I could pick things up quick"
"Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it"
"Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker"
"Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later, hehe"

Ive had everything in life that people strive for (Strive for)
"Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?"" (Alive for)"
What you believe? And would you agree?
"Well, what would you die for? (Die for)"
Is there a reason? What is the meaning? What do we cry for?
"One thing I know is were in this together, together, oh"
"One thing I know is were in this together, together, oh"
Were in this together
I moved out when I was eighteen
I was livin in a mansion doin big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin dicey
I was doin stupid shit to get people to like me
"All that to say, Im thankful thats not who I am"
And Im thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
Cause Hes the reason that Im still standin
"And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin"
"Plannin peace, plannin joy, plan another day"
Gave His life upon the cross to wash our sins away
Ive had everything in life that people strive for
"Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?"""

We reject what we dont understand
We turn our backs on a fellow man
"I wanna change, but my heart is bleedin"
"Heart is hard, and cant nobody see me"
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I cant stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous cause they wanna be me

My unforgiveness keeps control of mе
"Damnit, I gotta get a hold of me"
"Gotta get a hold of mе, oh"
What you want out of life? Thats the question

"Well, I dont know, of course I can fake it"
"But honestly, can I go wrong?"
"Im so tired, Im so broken, Im so weary"
When the day is over
And those thoughts set in
That’s when I start to wonder
Where do I fit in?
But then You remind me that You’re holding me tight
You say the past is behind me and it’ll be alright
"And You say to me, it’ll be alright"
When I’m all alone and fear is all I see
Sitting in the silence with these insecurities
"Its then You remind me, You’re holding me tight"
"And You love me completely, You’re always by my side"
"And You say to me, it’ll be alright"
"I know You’re not a God out there hiding on mountains, oh no"
"You come right where I am, lost my way but You found me"
"Like a ray in the dark, on my ugliest days"
You say that You’ll always love me just the same
And then You remind me that You’re holding me tight
You said the past is behind me and it will be alright
"Oh, and You say to me it’ll be alright"
"Gonna be alright, gonna be alright"
"It will, it will be alright"
"I hear those words over and over, “It’ll be alright”"
"Go to sleep, my child, it’ll be alright"
"Sleep soundly, my child, it’ll be alright"
"I’m right here, my child, it’ll be alright"
"I won’t go anywhere, it’ll be alright"
"You’re in the palm of my hand, it’ll be alright"
"My arms are wrapped around you, it’ll be alright"
"While you sleep, I watch over you, it’ll be alright"
"I’ll take care of your loved ones, it’ll be alright"
"Your future’s in my hands, it’ll be alright"
"Your past is forgiven, it’ll be alright"
"Your future is secure, it’ll be alright"
"I forgive you, it’ll be alright"
"I’m your friend that’s closer than a brother, it’ll be alright"
Sleep now for when the morning comes

"""Is there anyone like Jesus?"
"Who is this Jesus?"""
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might become right in our relationship with God?
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
"Three days later, did He rise again as the grave empty?"
"Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?"

Im afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And Im afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back
Do we got the room to make mistakes?
"Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
"I wanna grow but Im afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
"And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
"Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
Cause Im really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybodys getting canceled
And cant there be room for maturity?
Cause writing em off is not the answer
"Do we got the room to make mistakes? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, do we?)"
"Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, are we?)"
"I wanna grow but Im afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
"And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
"Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
Cause Im really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
"When everybodys getting canceled (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)"
And cant there be room for maturity?
Cause writing em off is not the answer
We cant write people off
God never writes us off
"Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it"
Even when were doing that stupid thing we wish we werent doing
"God never writes us off, ever"
"Hes with us in our pain, Hes with us in our struggle"
Hes with us in our bad decisions
"Hes with us all the time, He never writes us off (He never writes us off)"
"You formed the whole of me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)"
"Inward and out (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)"
"I am awesomely and wonderfully created (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)"
Your creations are spectacular
"You skillfully designed me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)"
"You saw the essence of me, before I was formed"
"Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book"
Its all gonna be okay
Its all gonna be okay
Its all gonna be okay
Ill be waiting for you
"Well, tell me is it wrong?"
Wrong for me to say this?
That our relationships been rough for a long time
"Well baby, do you care?"
"Care about my heart, babe?"
Acting like its always you
"Baby girl, I want to make you"
I wanna make you mine
Its all gonna be okay

Cause I got you
And Ill never let you go-go-go
So when the lights turn off
And this love dont last
There is one question I would ask
"Is it cause when we first started, we was movin really fast"
It is cause it was blurry and we worried by the past
"Well now baby girl, Im starting fresh"
Every time I see you like we never met
"Better yet, Imma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris"
Baby girl you who I cherish
Dont get worried about your parents
And girl Ill be your biggest crush
When I walk up in the room
"Girl, You know I see you blush, hush!"
"Girl, I know you feel this lust"
"Girl, you always on my side, cause you know that, thats a must, yes us"
"Tell me, Do you love me?"

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
"He fell in love with his best friend, when shes around, he feels nothing but joy"
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well youre the smile on my face and I aint going nowhere
"Im here to make you happy, Im here to see you smile"
But Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Whos gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Dont have to be scared at all, oh my love"
"But you cant fly unless you let you, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall"
Well I can tell youre afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose
Well I dont want to lose it either
"But I dont think I can stay sitting around while youre hurting babe, so take my hand"
Well did you know youre an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
"Cause I know that a piece of yous gone every time he done wrong, Im the shoulder youre crying on"
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song Ill have figured out
Whos gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Dont have to be scared at all, oh my love"
"But you cant fly unless you let you, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall"
I will catch you if you fall
"I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall"
"And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me"
"But you cant fly unless you let you, you cant fly unless you let yourself"
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Dont have to be scared at all, oh my love"
Everybodys laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading bout this other guy

You worked two jobs
To keep a roof above our heads
"A life for me, no you never gave up"
"I admire you, for the strength you’ve instilled in me"
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
"Cause I, I still turn to you"
"I still turn to you, I still turn to you"
The year that everything started to change
"You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways"
Then you found the Lord
"You gave your life to Him, and you could not ignore the love he had for you"
And I wanted more of your heart
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
"Cause I, I still turn to you"
I don’t know what I’d if you left me
(So please don’t go away)
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher (you higher)
"Cause I, I still turn to you (to you, to you, to you)"

Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas therell be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what lifes really worth
Therell be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas well see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas therell be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me

She walked and she been in a mission
After nothing but damn right intentions (somebody)
I ain’t see nothing but diamonds
"They talking, she listening"
Screaming and laugh from a distance
Does she coming or missing
Be wise by who you calling your own
"Cause you might be left alone, thats right"
"This stars so bright, she can not put too far though"
She get it back tomorrow

Go spread your wings just like an eagle and fly
Oh don’t you look back after you conquer the sky
"Never wanna run away, never let your work be in vain"
When you see the finish line is in your face
"Have no pain, no pain"
When love is all you have to give
"You gotta let it persevere through the pain, any pain"
Let your light shine through
Don’t let none get in your way
"No pain (no pain), no pain (oh, no pain)"
"Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah"
"No pain, fearless, oh no pain"
"Oh woah, oh woah, no pain"
When I was young I used to sing out on the block
"No one came in your space, I had to make my own spot, aye"
"Staying determined, wasn’t easy at times"
"Never stopping your focus, till all fell in line"
"Never did I run away, never let my work be in vain"
When the finish line was in my face
"Have no pain, no pain"
When love is all you have to give
"You gotta let it persevere through the pain, any pain"
Let your light shine through
Don’t let none get in your way
"No pain (no pain), no pain (oh no pain)"
"Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah"
"No pain, fearless, oh no pain"
"Oh woah, oh woah, no pain"

Running everywhere trying to find who I am
Going nowhere so Im trying again
I am so lost like paper no pen
"Yes you have call so, yes, here I am"
My tole is red then the fire in my eyes
Imma rain no weather

When the storm from Jehovah comes
Im gonna be the best ever
Love from the start
Peace in my heart

But I still wonder
Have I felt the thunder?
I can feel it in my heart shooting like a like a hunter

"Yeah the things in my heart, makes things change"
How I felt before makes my brain rearrange
And what I do it for is definitely not the same
Can I just take a minute?
"Yeah, just wait a minute"
Starting to hate the minute
We have to pay the minute
Yah alright ok the minute
Or we could wait a minute
See how many times it just takes to say a minute
"Life is so short, but we just take it for granted"
Hand over my life and it was a life I was handed
"Flying so high and, yes, I just landed"
Im tryna figure out what my plan is
"His hand is on my life, and my sin just vanished"
My filth washes of quick like her fake tan is
Im growing up quick like a grown man is

Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah
"You know you love me, I know you care"
"Just shout whenever, And Ill be there"
"You are my love, You are my heart"
And we will never ever-ever be apart
Are we an item
What are you sayin?
Said theres another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like
"Baby, baby, baby ooh"
"Like baby, baby, baby noo"
"Like baby, baby, baby ooh"
"Thought youd always be mine, mine"
"Baby, baby, baby oohh"
"Like baby, baby, baby noo"

"For you, I would have done what ever"
And I just cant believe we aint together
"And I wanna play it cool, But Im losing you"
"Ill buy you anything, ill buy you any ring"
"And Im in pieces, Baby fix me"
And just shake me til you wake me from this bad dream
"Im going down, down, down, down"
"And I just cant believe, my first love wont be around"
"Baby, baby, baby oooh"
"Like baby, baby, baby noo"

Life is but a moment
And every single time you wanna give up
"Hold on tight to what you love, and dont let go"
And every single time you wanna break
Break from your troubles
"Take a breath, every step"
"Let it wash away, wash away (Oh, oh)"
"years ago, its never ever been the same"
And all my life I never wanted to play the game
Im not the same as Michael even though the hall of fame
Im all hall of faith
Put me on the wall of change
I got a couple things I learned along the way
Figured out how to mean what I say
I just gotta be me

I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better
Cause on nights like this
It’s good to know that youve got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
"And then you say, hope this will last forever"

Rockin around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later well have some pumpkin pie
And well do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
"Voices singing, ""Lets be jolly"
"Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"""

I never thought that itd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and were wondering how
"No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark"
"And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart"
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
"Down to Earth, down to Earth"
On our way back down to Earth
"And mama you were always somewhere, and daddy I live out of town"
So tell how could I ever be normal somehow?
"You tell me this is for the best, so tell me why am I in tears?"
"Woah, so far away, and now I just need you here"
So well fight through the hurt
And well cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
"Down to Earth, down to Earth"
On our way back down to Earth
We fell so far away from where we used to be
And now were standing and where do we go?
When theres no road to get to your heart
Lets start over again
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
"Down to Earth, down to Earth"
On our way back down to Earth
I never thought that itd be easy
Cause we both so distant now

I hear a lot about sinners
Dont think that I’ll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
"Yeah, its making me say"
"That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me"
"Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy"
Runnin’ to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
"Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me"
I dont do well with the drama
"And, no, I cant stand it being fake"
"(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)"
I dont believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave mе life
"Baby, I cant explain"
"That the way you hold mе, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me"
"Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Yes, oh God)"
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Can’t wait another second
"’Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me"
They say were too young and
"The pimps and the players say, ""Don’t go crushin"""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say were too young and
"The pimps and the players say, ""Don’t go crushin"""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
"Im a believer, my heart is fleshy"
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
"They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy"
"But they dont see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi"
"Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi hit the jet speed"
"When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi"
Lets take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
"I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin next week"
"I wanna honor, wanna honor you, brides groom, Im my fathers child"
"I know when the son takes the first steps, the Fathers proud"
"If you make it to the water, Hell part the clouds"
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
"Formalize the union in communion, He can trust"
I know I aint leavin you like I know He aint leavin us
"I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us"
"Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me"

"This is the time a year we can give it, give it, give it, give it all"
"One through ten on your list you can get it, get it, get it, get it now"
Make your wish tonight when you open your eyes
"When the lights go bright, girl, Ill be right there"
"Baby, you deserve everything you want, its your night, oh"

But yesterday we were
"We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun"
And my heart was convinced to say that youre the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
"With no doubt looking round, thinking that Im so cool"
"Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?"
Finally if I didnt make her cry
She wouldnt be with another guy
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause Im experiencing what they call heartbreak
It’s gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I cant shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say its only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here
Now Im all tore up taking back when I was at your door
"The first time when you said, ""Forever Ill be yours"""
"Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger"
We made a promise
"And whenever I leave, it feels like youre still with me"
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
"What am I to do when I look up and you’re not there, woah?"
Say Im too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
"But, if only this is love I could get over"
I know I have to deal with the pain
"When I see you, you dont think I run up on you (You dont think I run up on you)"
And I dont want a text when I flex on you (When I flex on you)
"Get it, mic check, one, two (One, two)"
"Get it, mic check, one, two (Mic check, one, two)"

I’m feeling nice right now
I’m feeling good to bro
I’m feeling really nice right now
I’m in my closet right now
Literally in your closet?
I’m literally in my closet right now recording this song like a g
You are a g bro
You’re a wrap bro
"Swaggy, swaggy, swaggy, swaggy"
"Oh, I ain’t never met a groupie"
All I meet is ladies
And I like my privacy
So I got a Mercedes
Got these chokers shaking
Reminding me have hated
Sorry ’bout the security
It’s only for your safety
Cause baby I’ll be pimpin’
Holler if you see me
I’m probably in Miami
With my girl in a bikini
Text me if you need me
Touch me if you’re greedy
‘Cause you’ll probably be with Nicki
Walking while she says Waikiki
How we the illest and the youngest?
I really don’t know how we the killest and the dumbest
Swear it’s really early
But I don’t know where the sun is
And girl just take my hand
While I knock away these hundreds
Cause the crowd is going crazy
Money coming in bundles
Sorry that I couldn’t see you
It’s hard to see through my stunners
Dumb blondes be sayin’ I’m the funnest
All I’m hearing is claps
Though I don’t know where the drum is
Girl you like it
So just give me the mic
And I’ll get you so excited
Tell me what you want
I’ll go home and write it
To a old school beat
Baby take your lip and bite it
Girl you got me and you gon’ make me work
Cause it’s usually a hobby
And no I really like you
And no it’s not your body
But trust me that’s a plus
Cause you’re hotter than wasabi
And I’m diggin’ on your kicks
Jokers talking ’bout karate
When I want a girl I just whip out the Maserati
No I can’t drive it
It’s only for the show
And I like to wear them diamonds
Watch them circus glow
Girl I’m on like a light bulb
Are you coming home from the night club?
‘Cause I tried to get in but I ain’t reached the height limit
That might be over but the night isn’t so I’m
So text me if you tryna chill with Wesley
Cause me and Mandy are chillin’
So don’t wear nothing dressy
Inside jokes are only funny when you get them
So (?) is the place to be (?) and I’m living in them dance halls
Alright J I think I got it from here
Turn them up a little bit
Baby I’m the man
I felt that you knew that
I’m out in Japan
Just because I do that
So baby don’t you stop it
Baby can you drop it
I give you my chain
I style like Kentucky
Money on my mind
And you on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too big for my time
And everybody know that
Baby I’m the man
If I’m the wonderman
And you’re in wonderland
Hey my name is JB
I’m always rocking Vans
And if I was your boyfriend
I would love you till the end
I’d kiss your face in public
You can tell all of your friends
Baby girl you got that body
Would you like to go to France?
We can fly there on my jet babe
I can give you jetlag
I don’t do Jamaica baby
I can make you sweat babe
And if you ain’t in the crew
You’ll never get this

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself

But what youve been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didnt and you know thats some middle school shit
"All we were was just friends, good friends that it"
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I dont have time to care and I couldnt if I tried
"So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight"
And its a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think Im still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times you made me feel small
"I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all"
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourselfEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Drink a Red Bull grew wings see the stamina

I used to live there til I moved to Atlanta
"Where the girls are so hot, here the girls are fine too"
"Catching Bieber fever, forget the swine flu"
Can I be the one to take you round town?
Be the one to call when youre feeling so down?
I could be your man
You could be my crown
"Bieber, first name last name!"
"Bieber, check it on the past lane!"
"Bieber, im always in the fast lane!"
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way to far away
V light blue and white
I just cant fall asleep tonight
Move over to the space where you should be
Even after you seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
All my life I’ve dreamed of love
Never thought it would hurt this much
Kiss goodbye await for your return
So I’ll be strong and hold onto
The picture and the thought of you
Getting all the love that you deserve
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
If home is where you are

"As a young man, I didnt understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt"
"I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didnt realize at the time that it wasnt funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance"
Thanks to friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those wrongs
Now that these mistakes from the past have become public I need to apologize again to all those I have offended
I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake
I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again
Ignorance has no place in our society and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future
I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say but telling the truth is always whats right

Take something and wave it
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
"Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out"
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
When you was just a young’un you’re looks but so precious
But now you’re grown up
So fly its like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
"Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out"
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
"Find out how to love, kiss and hug"
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
Youre the one I need
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
"Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out"
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault
Wasn’t in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don’t want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
"Baby, so don’t be mad"
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart

You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love

"Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement"
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles til Im at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But Im still thinking bout what my mother would say
As Im singing an old song she used to sing
When things werent going the way she wanted them to
"I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do"
"I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you"
"I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do"
But shell be worried sick if I do if I do
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy mamas boy
Just dont run off and leave my mama at home
Cause Im her boy mamas boys
"Just dont run away, run away"
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy
Mamas boy just dont
So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish theyd let me ride away with them
Still havent got over it yet
Its been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPods the same tune my mother would sing
When things werent going the way she wanted them to
"I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do"
"I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you"
"I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do"
But shell be worried sick if I do if I do
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy mamas boy
Just dont run off and leave my mama at home
Cause Im her boy mamas boys
"Just dont run away, run away"
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy
Mamas boy just dont
Never get mad enough to walkout
If I do then I wont be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what Ill love her just the same
"Thats my mama, yeah"
So no matter what I aint leaving unless shes coming soon
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy mamas boy
Just dont run off and leave my mama at home
Cause Im her boy mamas boys
"Just dont run away, run away"
Cant run away and leave my mama alone

You were my sun
You were my earth
"But you didnt know all the ways I loved you, no"
So you took a chance
And made other plans
"But I bet you didnt think that they would come crashing down, no"
You dont have to say what you did
"I already know, I found out from him"
Now theres just no chance
With you and me
And dont it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
"Now its your turn, to cry"
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasnt like you only talked to him and you know it
Dont act like you dont know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin with my head (messin with my head)
Then you may not have blown it
You dont have to say what you did
"I already know, I found out from him"
Now theres just no chance
With you and me
And dont it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me

Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles Im used to seeing just werent there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear [?] was
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
"Kick their shoes off, put their feet up"
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When theres a place at your table
Theres a little hope for you and I
I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know theres something I can do
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
"Kick their shoes off, put their feet up"
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When theres a place at your table
Theres a little hope for you and I
Make room at your table for your friends and family
"Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat"
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
"Kick their shoes off, put their feet up"
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When theres a place at your table
Theres a little hope for you and I
I dont wanna go to sleep (I dont wanna go to sleep)
Cause then the day would end (Then the day would end)
I want this to last (To last) forever
And the closer that we get (Closer that we get)
Is that we take another step (Take another step)
"Seperation (Seperation), dedication (Dedication)"
I wanna make it (I wanna make it)
"Your hearts in need of renovation, inspiration"
So close that you can almost taste it
"Youre amazing, whoa oh"
"Put your trust in mе, yeah"
"Aint gotta worry bout that, going nowhere"
"Put your trust in me, yeah, hey, yeah"
"Aint gotta second guess that, in no kind of way"
Go ahead and put your trust in me

I wanna make it (I wanna make it)

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
"Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds"
Every beat like a image in the background
"Im sitting here, thinking where is you now"
I wanna tell you but theres too many people round
You know I love you
I care but its unfair
I aint perfect but Im tryna be the best I can
If its real than its gon come back again
"So Im letting go, I hope you understand"
"All your friends say, he dont love you"
And the grown ups say its puppy
"Love aint lust, Its more unlucky"
"Until you meet a diamond girl, now its sunny"
"Loving you, it was us against the World"
"You my favourite girl, for you I would go to war"
"I, take this all in just to show you"
Or maybe Im just stuck in the moment
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Never had to hide like
"You and I, both know it cant work"
Its all fun and games
Til someone gets hurt
I wont let that be you
Now you dont wanna let go
And I dont wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Now we dont wanna fall but
Were trippin in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
Im still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I got you baby
Fightin every inch of our fibers
Cuz aint no way its gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you dont wanna let go
And I dont wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
And we dont wanna fall but
Were tripping in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
And I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
Im still stuck in the moment with you
"See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we cant be"
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I aint with it
And I dont wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So well never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
(Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space
Im still stuck in the moment with you
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
"Oh no, oh no babe"

And all the clubs you get in using my name
"You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake"
"You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint"
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
"I dont, but you still hit my phone up"
"And baby, Ill be movin on"
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
"And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on"
"But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own"
Cause if you like the way you look that much
"Oh baby, you should go and love yourself"
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care

Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
Its like youre stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it aint over
"Oh, even in the midst of doubt"
Life is worth living
"Life is worth living, so live another day"
The meaning of forgiveness
"People make mistakes, doesnt mean you have to give in"
Life is worth living again
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
"Cause my heart, its just that cold"
Skating on thin ice
But its strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
"He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last"
For that long journey ahead
Said it aint ever over
"Oh, even in the midst of doubt"

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
"You know I try, but I dont do too well with apologies"
"I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?"
Can we both say the words and forget this
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
"By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times"
"So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight"
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?

"Oh baby, you should go and love yourself"
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
"I dont, but you still hit my phone up"
"And baby, Ill be movin on"
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
"And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on"
"But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own"

"Look at all the promises that Ive kept, ohh"

Youre not hard to reach
And youve given me the best gift
That Ive ever known
You give me purpose
"Yeah, youve given me purpose"
Thinking my journeys come to an end

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
"You know I try, but I dont do too well with apologies"
"I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?"
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
"By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times"
"So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight"
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
Cause Im missing more than just your body

Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

Can we both say the words and forget this?
"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"

My life is a movie and everyones watching
So lets get to the good part and past all the nonsense
Sometimes its hard to do the right thing
When the pressures coming down like lightning
Its like they want me to be perfect
When they dont even know that Im hurting
"Cause lifes not easy, Im not made out of steel"
"Dont forget that Im human, dont forget that Im real"
"Act like you know me, but you never will"
Theres onе thing that I know for sure
"Ive got to learn things, lеarn them the hard way"
"Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say"

If I believe in love
And you believe in love
"Then we could be in love, somehow"
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
"Some people separate, yeah"
Don’t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
"That’s what we oughta do, yeah"
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
"Cause we are strong enough to endure, oh"
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
"Then we can be in love, somehow"
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
"Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?"
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?
"Yeah, sometimes the heart can see"
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
"Lets be strong enough to endure, oh"

And you believe in love

"You know you love me, I know you care"
"Just bleed whenever, and Ill be there"
"You are my honey, you are my heart"
And we will never ever ever be apart
"If I was your idiot, Id never let you run"
"Keep you on my arm, youd never be alone"
"I can be your chest, anything you want"
"If I was your idiot, Id never let you run, Id never let you run"
"Sweat heart, sweat heart, swеat heart yikes"
"Like baby, baby, baby nooo"
"Likе sweat heart, sweat heart, sweat heart yikes"
I thought youd always be mine (mine)
When I met you sweat heart my feet went buzz
Now them flamingos in my eyebrows wont stop stop
And even though its a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep singing to the mountain top
Theres gonna be one more feet going buzz
One more feet going buzz
One more feet going buzz
"Your lips, my biggest weakness"
Shouldnt have let you know
Im always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
From a thousand miles away
When you chatter I chatter (oh whoa)
"You travel, I travel"
"Na na na, na na na, na na yikes"
"Na na na, na na na, na na na yikes"
If I was your idiot
"Na na na, na na na, na na na yikes"
"Na na na, na na na, na na na yikes"
If I was your idiot
My friends say Im a fool to think
That youre the one for me
I guess Im just a kind fool for my sweat heart
Right in front of my love fear
Right now than I ever wanted
A statue of marble outlined in grace
With an unpolished finish but something catches
Belong to you cancel our dinner
Max and coraline feed jackys gerbil
Spend another day Im giving
These sheets are so close
Who swayed to suede
Youll hear it all dont call
Throw away everything Ive written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today
Thoughtless rhymes I know its hard
"Be married, Im only halfway home"
And I cant believe you got kicked
Off a date and dropped you stars
Who swayed to suede
Youll hear it all dont call
Throw away everything Ive written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today
Me back in time
Need you here I am drunk
The dream before we were fleeing
Scene goes frame by frame
Who swayed to suede
Youll hear it all dont call
Throw away everything Ive written you oh
Anything just like every single thing todayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
